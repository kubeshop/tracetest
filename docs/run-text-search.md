# Text Search

Tracetest enables you to find the information you need more easily by using the text search input at the top of the Diagram view.
There you can type anything you want to find and the app will try to match it with any span attribute key & value while highlighting the options for you.

To use this feature go to the any run details page and identify the search input.
After that simply add any text you want to look for.
