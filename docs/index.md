Tracetest allows you to quickly build integration and e2e tests, powered by your OpenTelementry traces.

- Point the system to your Jaeger or Tempo trace datastore.
- Define a triggering transaction, such as a GET against an API endpoint.
- The system runs this transaction, returning both the response data and a full trace.
- Define tests & assertions against this data, ensuring both your response and the underlying processes worked correctly, quickly, and without errors.
- Save your test.
- Run the tests either manually or via your CI build jobs.
