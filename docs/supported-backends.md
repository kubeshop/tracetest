# Supported Backends

Currently, Tracetest supports the following backend data stores:

- Jaeger
- Grafana Tempo
- OpenSearch
- SignalFX

Details of configuring Tracetest to access these is discussed in the [installation instructions](/docs/installing.md).

We will be adding new data stores over the next couple of months - [let us know](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) the ones you would to see us add support for.
