# Supported Backends

Currently, Tracetest supports the following backend datastores:

- Jaeger
- Grafana Tempo

Details of configuring Tracetest to access these is discussed in the [installation instructions](/docs/advanced-selectors.md).

We will be adding new datastores over the next couple months - [let us know](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) the ones you would to see us add support for.
