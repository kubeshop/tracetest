# Adding Assertions

Assertions may be added to a trace to set a value for a step in the trace to determine success or failure.

After you have created a test and your test run is complete, click the **Add Assertion** button at the bottom right of the trace screen.

The **Add Assertion** dialog opens.

You can also create assertions by hovering over the **+** sign to the right of an attribute in the trace.

This will populate the assertion with the correct information for that attribute.

The **Filter** field allows for limiting the spans affected by the assertion.
