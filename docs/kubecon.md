# OTel-Demo testing game @ KubeconNA 2022


Play our game, learn to run trace-based tests using TraceTest, get familiar with the [OpenTelemetry Community Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo), and win a Plushie!

We have deployed the otel demo at [http://otel-demo.tracetest.io/](http://otel-demo.tracetest.io/), and a Tracetest instance ready to connect to it at [http://tracetest-otel-demo.tracetest.io/](http://tracetest-otel-demo.tracetest.io/)


## Instructions

1. Go to [http://tracetest-otel-demo.tracetest.io/](http://tracetest-otel-demo.tracetest.io/)

2. Create a new test. The goal will be to run tests over a trace generated by a call to the `Checkout API`. You can use the `Choose example` dropdown to select the correct one. Add your name to the name of the test.

3. When the test finishes running, you will be able to see and play around with the generated trace. Now comes the interesting part.

4. Using the `Test` section, find your way into adding `Test Specs` to do the following assertions:

    - All spans with a type of `RPC` have been successful (a.k.a `grpc.status_code` equals 0)
    - Since we’re trying to checkout an empty cart, the shipping cost will be zero. Assert that the `get-quote` span reflects that information
    - Finally, we want to be sure the user provided credit card is valid, so make sure the `charge` span shows if the given card is valid or not.


5. Don’t forget to "Publish" your changes once you created all your specs.

6. Complete [our survey](https://forms.gle/pAyCFjKUeBAKhTFP7). You will need to copy/paste your test URL. Make sure it is correct by copy/pasting it into a new browser window. If it’s correct, you should see your test with all the specs you added.

7. Come by the stand and reclaim your plushie!
