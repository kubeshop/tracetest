When defining a TraceID trigger, you are required to define a name for the TraceID variable. Then you use an existing TraceID from your tracing backend to run a test.

> Please note you are required to use a [Native Connection Tracing Backend integration](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/overview#native-connection-polling) with Tracetest.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: traceid
  traceid:
    id: <TraceID>
```
