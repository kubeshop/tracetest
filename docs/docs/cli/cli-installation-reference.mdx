This page contains a reference of all options for installing Tracetest CLI.

Tracetest has a command line interface (CLI) which includes:

- [Tracetest Agent](/configuration/agent): Enables Tracetest to access your application under test and to ingest trace data from your OpenTelemetry Collector or tracing backend.
- [Tracetest Core Install Wizard](/core/getting-started/installation): Helps install the Tracetest Core Server into Docker or Kubernetes.

The CLI is used to run tests, download or upload tests, and manage Tracetest capability and resources.

## Installing the Tracetest CLI in different operating systems

Every time we release a new version of Tracetest, we generate binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Supporting both amd64, and ARM64 architectures, in `tar.gz`, `deb`, `rpm` and `exe` formats.

You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/releases/latest).

### Linux/MacOS

Tracetest CLI can be installed automatically using the following script:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash
```

It works for systems with Homebrew, `apt-get`, `dpkg`, `yum`, `rpm` installed, and if no package manager is available, it will try to download the build and install it manually.

You can also manually install it with one of the following methods.

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew install kubeshop/tracetest/tracetest
```

#### APT

```sh
# requirements for our deb repo to work
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates

# add repo
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/tracetest/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list

# update and install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tracetest
```

#### YUM

```sh
# add repository
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/tracetest.repo
[tracetest]
name=Tracetest
baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/tracetest/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# install
sudo yum install tracetest --refresh
```

### Windows

#### Chocolatey

```bash
choco source add --name=kubeshop_repo --source=https://chocolatey.kubeshop.io/chocolatey ; choco install tracetest
```

#### From source

Download one of the files from the latest tag, extract to your machine, and then [add the tracetest binary to your PATH variable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41895179).

## Installing a specific version of the Tracetest CLI

You can request to install a specific version by appending `-s -- [version]` to the installation script.

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- [version]
```

If you would want version `v0.13.0` you would run this command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- v0.12.1
```

This method skips package managers and directly downloads the build from the release page.

Due to this, if the Tracetest CLI was previously installed using a package manager, that version will still exist in the system, so depending on the `$PATH` environment variable configuration, that version might take precedence over the specific version you installed with the install script.
