This page contains a reference of all options for installing Tracetest CLI.

Tracetest has a command line interface (CLI) which includes:

- [Tracetest Agent](/configuration/agent): Enables Tracetest to access your application under test and to ingest trace data from your OpenTelemetry Collector or tracing backend.

The CLI is used to run tests, download or upload tests, and manage Tracetest capability and resources.

## Installing the Tracetest CLI in different operating systems

Every time we release a new version of Tracetest, we generate binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Supporting both amd64, and ARM64 architectures, in `tar.gz`, `deb`, `rpm` and `exe` formats.

You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/releases/latest).

### Linux/MacOS

Tracetest CLI can be installed automatically using the following script:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash
```

It works for systems with Homebrew, `apt-get`, `dpkg`, `yum`, `rpm` installed, and if no package manager is available, it will try to download the build and install it manually.

You can also manually install it with one of the following methods.

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew install kubeshop/tracetest/tracetest
```

#### APT

```sh
# requirements for our deb repo to work
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates

# add repo
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/tracetest/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list

# update and install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tracetest
```

#### YUM

```sh
# add repository
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/tracetest.repo
[tracetest]
name=Tracetest
baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/tracetest/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# install
sudo yum install tracetest --refresh
```

### Windows

#### Chocolatey

```bash
choco source add --name=kubeshop_repo --source=https://chocolatey.kubeshop.io/chocolatey ; choco install tracetest
```

#### From source

Download one of the files from the latest tag, extract to your machine, and then [add the tracetest binary to your PATH variable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41895179).

## Installing a specific version of the Tracetest CLI

You can request to install a specific version by appending `-s -- [version]` to the installation script.

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- [version]
```

If you would want version `v0.13.0` you would run this command:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- v0.12.1
```

This method skips package managers and directly downloads the build from the release page.

Due to this, if the Tracetest CLI was previously installed using a package manager, that version will still exist in the system, so depending on the `$PATH` environment variable configuration, that version might take precedence over the specific version you installed with the install script.
