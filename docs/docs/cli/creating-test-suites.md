# Defining Test Suites as Text Files

This page showcases how to create and edit Test Suites with the CLI.

Just like other structures of Tracetest, you can also manage your Test Suites using the CLI and definition files.

A definition file for a Test Suite looks like the following:

```yaml
type: TestSuite
spec:
  name: Test purchase flow
  description: Test a flow of purchasing an item
  steps:
    - ./tests/create-product.yaml
    - ./tests/add-product-to-cart.yaml
    - ./tests/complete-purchase.yaml
    - testID # you can also reference tests by their ids instead of referencing the definition file
```

In order to apply this Test Suite to your Tracetest instance, make sure to have your [CLI configured](./configuring-your-cli.md) and run:

```sh
tracetest apply testsuite -f <testsuite.yaml>
```

> If the file contains the property `spec.id`, the operation will be considered a Test Suite update.
