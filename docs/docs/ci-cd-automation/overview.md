# CI/CD Automation

This section contains a general overview of running Tracetest in CI/CD pipelines.

You can find guides for:

- [GitHub Actions](./github-actions-pipeline)
- [Testkube](./testkube-pipeline)
- [Tekton](./tekton-pipeline)

Tracetest is designed to work with all CI/CD platforms and automation tools. To enable Tracetest to run in CI/CD environments, make sure to [install the Tracetest CLI](../getting-started/installation.mdx) and configure it to access your [Tracetest server](../configuration/server.md).

To read more about integrating Tracetest with CI/CD tools, check out tutorials in our blog:
