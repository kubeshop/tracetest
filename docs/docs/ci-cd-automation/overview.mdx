This section contains a general overview of running Tracetest in CI/CD pipelines.

You can find guides for:

- [GitHub Actions with Secrets](/ci-cd-automation/github-actions-pipeline-with-secrets)
- [Testkube](/ci-cd-automation/testkube-pipeline)
- [Tekton](/ci-cd-automation/tekton-pipeline)

Tracetest is designed to work with all CI/CD platforms and automation tools. To enable Tracetest to run in CI/CD environments, make sure to [install the Tracetest CLI](../getting-started/installation.mdx) and configure it to access your [Tracetest server](../core/configuration/server.mdx).

## Running Tracetest CLI from Docker

Many integrations with CI/CD tools can be accomplished by running the [Tracetest CLI](../cli/configuring-your-cli) to execute a test against a remote Tracetest server. If you do not want to install the Tracetest CLI in your environment, you can choose to directly execute it from a Docker image.

**How to Use**:

Use the command below, substituting the following placeholders:

- `your-tracetest-server-url` - the URL to the running Tracetest server you wish to execute the test on. Example: `http://localhost:11633/`
- `file-path` - The path to the saved Tracetest test. Example: `./mytest.yaml`

```bash wordWrap=true
docker run --rm -it -v$(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) --network host --entrypoint tracetest kubeshop/tracetest:latest -s <your-tracetest-server-url> run test --file <file-path>
```
