[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

## GitHub Actions Workflow for Running Tracetest tests against a sample Node.js app with OpenTelemetry

This is a simple quick start on how to configure GitHub Actions to run Tracetest tests against a Node.js app thats uses OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces. This example includes manual instrumentation and a sample bookstore array that simulates fetching data from a database.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

This sample has two workflows. The workflows have one job and a total of 6 steps. The steps are:

1. Checking out the repo code
2. Starting the sample app with Docker Compose
3. Installing the Tracetest CLI
4. Configuring the Tracetest CLI
5. Running tests with the Tracetest CLI
6. Stop Docker Compose

The first workflow triggers a pre-merge and merge test run.

```yaml
# start-and-test-on-main.yaml

name: Docker Compose Start and Test on push and PR to main

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  start-and-test:
    timeout-minutes: 10
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Start containers
      run: docker compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" -f "tracetest/docker-compose.yaml" up -d --build

    - name: Install Tracetest CLI
      shell: bash
      run: curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash

    - name: Configure Tracetest CLI
      run: tracetest configure -g --endpoint http://localhost:11633

    - name: Run tests via the Tracetest CLI
      run: |
        tracetest run test -f ./tracetest/tests/test-api.yaml
        tracetest run test -f ./tracetest/tests/test-api-and-av.yaml
        tracetest run testsuite -f ./tracetest/tests/testsuite-api.yaml

    - name: Stop containers
      if: always()
      run: docker compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" -f "tracetest/docker-compose.yaml" down -v
```

And, the other is a scheduled test run.

```yaml
# start-and-test-on-schedule.yaml

name: Docker Compose Start and Test Every Hour

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  start-and-test:
    timeout-minutes: 10
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Start containers
      run: docker compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" -f "tracetest/docker-compose.yaml" up -d --build

    - name: Install Tracetest CLI
      shell: bash
      run: curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash

    - name: Configure Tracetest CLI
      run: tracetest configure -g --endpoint http://localhost:11633

    - name: Run tests via the Tracetest CLI
      run: |
        tracetest run test -f ./tracetest/tests/test-api.yaml
        tracetest run test -f ./tracetest/tests/test-api-and-av.yaml
        tracetest run testsuite -f ./tracetest/tests/testsuite-api.yaml

    - name: Stop containers
      if: always()
      run: docker compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" -f "tracetest/docker-compose.yaml" down -v
```

## Project structure

Let's first explain how the example app is built. It uses Docker Compose, and contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files. As you see in the GitHub Actions Workflow, all services in the example app are started with Docker Compose.

### 1. Node.js app

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest.config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `tracetest` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling OpenTelemetry traces and trace-based testing with Tracetest.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `tracetest:4317` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `tracetest` service, where the port `4317` is the port where Tracetest accepts traces.

## Node.js app

The Node.js app is a simple Express app with two microservices, contained in the `app.js` and `availability.js` files.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files, respectively.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node");
const {
  getNodeAutoInstrumentations,
} = require("@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node");
const {
  OTLPTraceExporter,
} = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc");
const { Resource } = require("@opentelemetry/resources");
const {
  SemanticResourceAttributes,
} = require("@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions");
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const { BatchSpanProcessor } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base");

const resource = Resource.default().merge(
  new Resource({
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]:
      "quick-start-nodejs-manual-instrumentation",
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_VERSION]: "0.0.1",
  })
);

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({ resource: resource });
const exporter = new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: "http://otel-collector:4317" });
const processor = new BatchSpanProcessor(exporter);
provider.addSpanProcessor(processor);
provider.register();

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: exporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  serviceName: "quick-start-nodejs-manual-instrumentation",
});
sdk.start();
```

Depending on which of these you choose, traces will be sent to either the `grpc` or `http` endpoint.

The hostnames and ports for these are:

- GRPC: `http://otel-collector:4317`
- HTTP: `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm script for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "app-with-grpc-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "app-with-http-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js",
  "availability-with-grpc-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js availability.js",
  "availability-with-http-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js availability.js"
},
```

To start the `app.js` Express server you run this command.

```bash
npm run app-with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run app-with-http-tracer
```

To start the `availability.js` Express server you run this command.

```bash
npm run availability-with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run availability-with-http-tracer
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` does not have a `CMD` section.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
```

Instead, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains the `CMD` section for both services.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    build: .
    command: npm run app-with-grpc-tracer
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  availability:
    image: quick-start-nodejs-availability
    build: .
    command: npm run availability-with-grpc-tracer
    ports:
      - "8080"
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app. But, you're not sending the traces anywhere.

Let's fix this by configuring Tracetest and OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with three services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provisioning.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provisioning.yaml
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60
    environment:
      TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.59.0
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
```

Tracetest depends on both Postgres and the OpenTelemetry Collector. Both Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

The `tracetest-config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable
```

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file provisions the trace data store and polling to store in the Postgres database. The data store is set to OTLP meaning the traces will be stored in Tracetest itself.

```yaml
---
type: PollingProfile
spec:
  name: Default
  strategy: periodic
  default: true
  periodic:
    retryDelay: 5s
    timeout: 10m

---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: OpenTelemetry Collector
  type: otlp
  default: true
```

But how are traces sent to Tracetest?

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Tracetest's otlp endpoint `tracetest:4317`.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/1:
    endpoint: tracetest:4317
    # Send traces to Tracetest.
    # Read more in docs here: https://docs.tracetest.io/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/1:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/1]
```

## Run both the Node.js app and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js services and Tracetest we will run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

## Run Tracetest tests with the Tracetest CLI

First, [install the CLI](https://docs.tracetest.io/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-cli).
Then, configure the CLI:

```bash
tracetest configure --endpoint http://localhost:11633
```

Once configured, you can run a test against the Tracetest instance via the terminal.

Check out the `test-api.yaml` file in the `./tracetest/tests` directory.

```yaml
type: Test
spec:
  id: W656Q0c4g
  name: Books List
  description: List of books
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://app:8080/books
      method: GET
      headers:
        - key: Content-Type
          value: application/json
  specs:
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /books" http.target="/books" http.method="GET"]
      assertions:
        - attr:http.status_code = 200
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Books List"]
      assertions:
        - attr:books.list.count = 4
```

To run the test, run this command in the terminal:

```bash
tracetest run test -f ./tracetest/tests/test-api.yaml
```

This test will fail just like the sample above due to the `attr:books.list.count = 4` assertion.

```
✘ http://app:8080 (http://localhost:11633/test/W656Q0c4g/run/5/test)
	✔ span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /books" http.target="/books" http.method="GET"]
		✔ #994c63e0ea35e632
			✔ attr:http.status_code = 200 (200)
	✘ span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Books List"]
		✘ #5ab1856c32b0d5c8
			✘ attr:books.list.count = 4 (3) (http://localhost:11633/test/W656Q0c4g/run/5/test?selectedAssertion=1&selectedSpan=5ab1856c32b0d5c8)
```

The tests will pass if you change the assertion to:

```css
attr: books.list.count = 3;
```

There are two more files in the `./tracetest/tests` directory that we use in the GitHub Actions Workflow.

The test `test-api-and-av.yaml` also includes assertions for the `availability` service.

```yaml
# ./tracetest/tests/test-api-and-av.yaml

type: Test
spec:
  id: phAZcrT4B
  name: Books list with availability
  description: Testing the books list and availability check
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://app:8080/books
      method: GET
      headers:
      - key: Content-Type
        value: application/json
  specs:
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /books" http.target="/books"
      http.method="GET"]
    assertions:
    - attr:tracetest.span.duration  < 500ms
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Books List"]
    assertions:
    - attr:books.list.count = 3
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /availability/:bookId" http.method="GET"]
    assertions:
    - attr:http.host = "availability:8080"
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Availablity check"]
    assertions:
    - attr:isAvailable = "true"
```

The testsuite `testsuite-api.yaml` will run both the tests above.

```yaml
# ./tracetest/tests/testsuite-api.yaml

type: TestSuite
spec:
  id: 3YIB7rPVg
  name: All Tests for the Books List API
  steps:
  - phAZcrT4W
  - phAZcrT4B
```
