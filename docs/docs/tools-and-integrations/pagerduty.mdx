[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on OpenTelemetry that permits you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use your trace data generated on your OpenTelemetry tools to check and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions. It also supports [Synthetic Monitoring](../examples-tutorials/recipes/synthetic-monitoring-trace-based-api-tests.mdx)

[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) is a powerful tool to let you know when things go wrong and require manual intervention to fix it.

By using Tracetest with PagerDuty, you can ensure your application runs as you expect and also get notified when it doesn't work.

## Quickstart

In this guide, we will show how to use Tracetest's Synthetic Monitoring to run these tests and use its webhook mechanism to alert you when things fail.

## Prerequisites

* A Tracetest account
* A PagerDuty account

### Create a PagerDuty Service

:::note
For a detailed guide, navigate to PagerDuty's support page [Services and Integrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#create-a-service).

To create a service in the PagerDuty web app:

1. Go to **Services** -> **Service Directory** and click **New Service**. On the next screen you will be guided through several steps.
   1. Enter **Name**. We suggest to put a cluster name, for example: "Production EU".
   2. Click **Next** to continue.

    3. Select "JSON" in the "Body" dropdown
    4. Paste the suggested body from the PagerDuty page and adjust the messages as needed, it should look like this:
    ```json

        "payload": {
            "summary": "Title of my alert",
            "severity": "critical",
            "source": "Alert source"
        },
