:::

[Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[k6](https://k6.io/) is an open-source performance testing tool used for testing the performance of APIs, microservices, and websites. It is designed to be developer-centric, making it easy for developers to write and maintain performance tests as code.

## Why is this important?

k6 is it's a great tool in its own right that allows you to replicate most of the production challenges you might encounter. But, as with all of the tools that only test the initial transaction between the client side and the server, you can only run validations against the immediate response from the service.

## The k6 Tracetest Extension

With the [k6 Tracetest extension](https://github.com/kubeshop/xk6-tracetest), you will unlock the power of OpenTelemetry that allows you to run deeper testing based on the traces and spans generated by each of the checkpoints that you define within your services.

Language and Vendor agnostic, with this extension you can use your existing Tracing Data Store and Setup to leverage the work you have already done to instrument your services.

## How It Works

The following is high level sequence diagram on how k6 and Tracetest interact with the different pieces of the system.

## Today You'll Learn About Performance & Trace-Based Tests

This is a simple quick start guide on how to run the Tracetest k6 extension to run enhanced performance tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use the Pokeshop Demo as a testing ground, triggering requests against it and generating telemetry data.

## Requirements

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Create an [environment](/concepts/environments).
- Create an [environment token](/concepts/environment-tokens).
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](/configuration/agent).

**Tracetest CLI**:

- [Download the CLI](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-cli).
- Configure the CLI to connect to your Tracetest environment with the environment token you created in the step above.

    ```bash
      tracetest configure -t <tttoken_1234567890>
    ```

**xk6:** To start using the Tracetest k6 binary you need to have the xk6 builder installed on your machine. You can [follow the instructions defined in this page](https://github.com/grafana/xk6/) to do that.

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Installing the k6 Tracetest Extension

Installing the k6 Tracetest extension is as easy as running the following command:

```bash
xk6 build v0.42.0 --with github.com/kubeshop/xk6-tracetest
```

This will generate the `k6-tracetest` binary in the current directory.

The instructions can be also found in the main [k6 docs](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/get-started/bundle/) in case you need to combine multiple extensions into one binary.

## Using the Tracetest Extension For Load Tests

Once you have installed the k6 Tracetest binary, you can use the base k6 functionality to run load tests against instrumented services and Tracetest to run checks against the resulting telemetry data.

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose.

### Pokeshop Demo App

The [Pokeshop Demo App](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview) is a complete example of a distributed application using different backend and front-end services, implementation code is written in Typescript.

The `docker-compose-yaml` file in the root directory is for the Pokeshop Demo app, the OpenTelemetry setup and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent).

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. For example, `jaeger:14250` in the `collector.config.yaml` file will map to the `jaeger` service, where port `14250` is the port where the Jaeger all-in-one instance accepts telemetry data.

## Creating Your Tracetest Test Definition

The `tests/test.yaml` file contains the test definition that will be used to run the tests. It uses the trace id trigger which is required for the k6 integrations as well as adding assertions using test-based TDD patterns.

```yaml
type: Test
spec:
  id: kc_MgKoVR
  name: K6
  description: K6
  trigger:
    type: traceid
    traceid:
      id: ${env:TRACE_ID}
  specs:
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="import pokemon"]
      name: Should have imported the pokemon
      assertions:
        - attr:tracetest.selected_spans.count = 1
    - selector: |-
        span[tracetest.span.type="http" net.peer.name="pokeapi.co" http.method="GET"]
      name: Should trigger a request to the POKEAPI
      assertions:
        - attr:http.url   =  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/6"
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="database" name="create postgres.pokemon"]
      name: Should insert the pokemon to the DB
      assertions:
        - attr:db.result | json_path '.name'  =  "charizard"
```

Create the test using the following command:

```bash
tracetest apply test -f ./tests/test.yaml
```

## Creating Your k6 Script

The `import-pokemon.js` file contains the k6 script that will be used to run the performance tests. It is a simple script that will trigger a `POST` request to the `/pokemon/import` Pokeshop Demo app endpoint.

```javascript
import { Http, Tracetest } from "k6/x/tracetest";
import { sleep } from "k6";

export const options = {
  vus: 1,
  duration: "5s",
};

const http = new Http();
const testId = "kc_MgKoVR";
const tracetest = Tracetest();

let pokemonId = 6; // charizard

export default function () {
  const url = "http://localhost:8081/pokemon/import";
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    id: pokemonId++,
  });
  const params = {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    tracetest: {
      testId,
    },
  };

  const response = http.post(url, payload, params);

  tracetest.runTest(
    response.trace_id,
    {
      test_id: testId,
      variable_name: "TRACE_ID",
      should_wait: true,
    },
    {
      id: "123",
      url,
      method: "GET",
    }
  );

  sleep(1);
}

export function handleSummary() {
  return {
    stdout: tracetest.summary(),
  };
}

export function teardown() {
  tracetest.validateResult();
}
```

## Tracetest Agent Connects to Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file includes the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) image, which is going to fetch traces from the Jaeger all-in-one instance and send them to Tracetest.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  tracetest-agent:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest-agent:latest
    environment:
      TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}
      TRACETEST_API_KEY: ${TRACETEST_API_KEY}
```

Do not forget to set the `TRACETEST_API_KEY` environment variable in the `.env` file to your Tracetest Agent. The API key available on the `Settings > Agent` page of your environment as you can see [here](/configuration/agent).

Configure Tracetest Agent to connect to the Jaeger instance running in Docker.

```yaml title=tracetest-datastore.yaml
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  id: current
  name: jaeger
  type: jaeger
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:16685
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest-datastore.yaml
```

## Run the Pokeshop Demo App and the Tracetest Agent

To start the full setup, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the Pokeshop Demo HTTP API on `http://localhost:8081/`.

## Run the k6 Script

Having the full setup ready, the final step is to run the k6 script. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
XK6_TRACETEST_API_TOKEN=<your-environment-token> ./k6 run ./import-pokemon.js -o xk6-tracetest
context menu


          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  |
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: ./import-pokemon.js
     output: xk6-tracetest-output (TestRunID: 38055)

  scenarios: (100.00%) 1 scenario, 1 max VUs, 35s max duration (incl. graceful stop):
           * default: 1 looping VUs for 5s (gracefulStop: 30s)

## What's Next?

After running the initial set of tests, you can click the run link for any of them, update the assertions and run the scripts once more. This flow enables complete a trace-based TDD flow.
