# OTel Semantic Conventions

The `Open Telemetry Semantic Conventions` plugin is responsible of analyzing the spans that are part of a trace in order to identify problematic patterns. The set of rules follows the OpenTelemetry conventions with the end goal of ensure quality in the telemetry data.

## Rules

- [span_naming](./rules/span_naming.md)
- [required_attributes](./rules/required_attributes.md)
- [attribute_naming](./rules/attribute_naming.md)
- [not_empty_attributes](./rules/not_empty_attributes.md)
