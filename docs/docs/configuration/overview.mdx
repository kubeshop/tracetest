To enable Tracetest to run end-to-end tests against trace data, you need to configure access. Tracetest is designed to work with tracing backends, or to ingest trace data via an OTLP ingest endpoint.

## Enable Tracetest to Access Your Application

There are two configuration options for triggering tests and ingesting trace data into Tracetest:

- [Tracetest Agent configuration (private access)](/configuration/agent): You run an agent locally in your environment, as a process, or in Docker/Kubernetes as a container. Prefferred option if you are using a VPC, firewall, etc.
- [Tracetest Cloud Agent configuration (public access)](/configuration/cloud-agent): We run an agent in your Tracetest account with publicly accesible endpoints. You manage nothing. Prefferred option if you are using serverless architectures.

## Connecting Tracetest to Tracing Backends

Tracetest supports [two types of tracing backend integrations](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/overview):

- Native connection (polling)
- OTLP ingest endpoint

## Access and Tracing Backend Configuration Examples

- View the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).
- Follow the [**Recipes**](/examples-tutorials/recipes) for guided walkthroughs of sample use cases.

We will be adding new data stores over the next couple of months - [let us know](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) any additional data stores you would like to see us support.
