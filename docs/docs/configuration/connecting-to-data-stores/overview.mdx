Tracetest allows you to connect your Tracing Backend to unlock the full potential of trace-based testing. Tracetest supports two types of tracing backend integrations.

## OTLP Ingest Endpoint

When not using a tracing backend, the OpenTelemetry Collector, or using a tracing backend integration that does not support a native connection, you'll use the Tracetest OTLP ingest endpoint.

Configure Tracetest Agent:
- [Tracetest Agent](/configuration/agent) exposes an OTLP endpoint that listens for trace data on ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP).
- [Tracetest Cloud Agent](/configuration/cloud-agent) exposes an OTLP endpoint that listens for trace data on TLS port `443` (both HTTP and gRPC).

Configure trace ingestion:
- [OTLP Ingestion Endpoint](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/otlp-ingestion-endpoint) is used to ingest OpenTelemetry traces.

### Supported OTLP Ingest Tracing Backends

Currently, Tracetest integrates with the following OTLP tracing backends. Click on the respective tracing backend to view configuration examples:

- [OpenTelemetry Collector](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector)
- [Azure App Insights](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights)
- [Datadog](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/datadog)
- [Dynatrace](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/dynatrace)
- [Instana](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/instana)
- [Lightstep](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/lightstep)
- [New Relic](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/new-relic)
- [SigNoz](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/signoz)

## Native Connection (Polling)

When using a tracing backend integration that supports the native connection, Tracetest will pull telemetry data directly from your tracing backend for every test run.

### Supported Native Tracing Backends

Currently, Tracetest supports the following tracing backends. Click on the respective tracing backend to view configuration examples:

- [AWS X-Ray](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray)
- [Azure App Insights](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights)
- [Elastic APM](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/elasticapm)
- [Grafana Tempo](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/tempo)
- [Jaeger](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/jaeger)
- [OpenSearch](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opensearch)
- [SignalFX](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/signalfx)
- [Sumo Logic](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/sumologic)

## Tracing Backend Configuration Examples

- View the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).
- Follow the [**Recipes**](/examples-tutorials/recipes) for guided walkthroughs of sample use cases.

We will be adding new data stores over the next couple of months - [let us know](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) any additional data stores you would like to see us support.
