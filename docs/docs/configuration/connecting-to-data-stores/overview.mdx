Tracetest supports two types of tracing backend integrations.

## Native Connection (Polling)

When using a tracing backend integration that supports the native connection, Tracetest will pull telemetry data directly from your tracing backend for every test run.

## OTLP Ingest Endpoint

When using a tracing backend integration that does not support a native connection, or no tracing backend at all, you'll resort to using the Tracetest OTLP ingest endpoint. [Tracetest Agent](/configuration/agent) exposes an OTLP endpoint that listens for trace data on ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP). As does [Tracetest Cloud Agent](/configuration/cloud-agent), but uses the same TLS port `443` for OTLP ingestion.

## Supported Tracing Backends

Currently, Tracetest supports the following data stores. Click on the respective data store to view configuration examples:

- [AWS X-Ray](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray)
- [Azure App Insights](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights)
- [Datadog](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/datadog)
- [Dynatrace](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/dynatrace)
- [Elastic APM](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/elasticapm)
- [Grafana Tempo](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/tempo)
- [Honeycomb](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/honeycomb)
- [Instana](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/instana)
- [Jaeger](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/jaeger)
- [Lightstep](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/lightstep)
- [New Relic](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/new-relic)
- [OpenSearch](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opensearch)
- [OpenTelemetry Collector](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector)
- [SignalFX](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/signalfx)
- [SigNoz](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/signoz)
- [Sumo Logic](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/sumologic)

## Using Tracetest without a Tracing Backend (OTLP ingest endpoint)

Another option is to send traces directly to Tracetest using the OpenTelemetry Collector. And, you don't have to change your existing pipelines to do so.

View [configuration for OpenTelemetry Collector](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector) for more details.

## Tracing Backend Configuration Examples

- View the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).
- Follow the [**Recipes**](/examples-tutorials/recipes) for guided walkthroughs of sample use cases.

We will be adding new data stores over the next couple of months - [let us know](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) any additional data stores you would like to see us support.
