# OpenTelemetry Collector

If you don't want to use a trace data store, you can send all traces directly to Tracetest using your OpenTelemetry Collector. And, you don't have to change your existing pipelines to do so.

:::note
It is important to notice that this relies on the [tailsampling](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor) processor, which, at the moment, is only available in the [contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/) version of the collector.

Examples of configuring Tracetest can be found in the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).

## Configuring OpenTelemetry Collector to Send Traces to Tracetest

In your OpenTelemetry Collector config file, make sure to set the `exporter` to `otlp/1`, with the `endpoint` pointing to your Tracetest instance on port `21321`. If you are running Tracetest with Docker, the endpoint might look like this `http://tracetest:21321`.

```yaml
# collector.config.yaml

# If you already have receivers declared, you can just ignore
# this one and still use yours instead.
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

  # you will need to add this processor in order to only send spans
  # generated by tests to your Tracetest instance.
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 5s
    policies:
      - name: tracetest-spans
        type: trace_state
        trace_state: { key: tracetest, values: ["true"] }

exporters:
  # This is the exporter that will send traces to Tracetest
  otlp/1:
    endpoint: http://your-tracetest-instance.com:21321
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    # your probably already have a traces pipeline, you don't have to change it.
    # just add this one to your configuration. Just make sure to not have two
    # pipelines with the same name
    traces/1:
      receivers: [otlp] # your receiver
      processors: [tail_sampling, batch] # make sure to have the tail_sampling before your batch processor
      exporters: [otlp/1] # your exporter pointing to your tracetest instance
```

### Configure Tracetest

You also have to configure your Tracetest instance to make it aware that there's no trace data store to pull traces from. Edit your configuration file to include this configuration:

```yaml
# tracetest.config.yaml

postgresConnString: "host=postgres user=postgres password=postgres port=5432 sslmode=disable"

poolingConfig:
  maxWaitTimeForTrace: 10s
  retryDelay: 1s

googleAnalytics:
  enabled: true

telemetry:
  dataStores:
    otlp:
      type: otlp
  exporters:
    collector:
      serviceName: tracetest
      sampling: 100 # 100%
      exporter:
        type: collector
        collector:
          endpoint: otel-collector:4317

server:
  telemetry:
    dataStore: otlp
    exporter: collector
    applicationExporter: collector

```
