Tracetest fetches traces from [Jaeger's gRPC Protobuf/gRPC QueryService](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.42/deployment/#query-service--ui) on port `16685`.

:::tip
Examples of configuring Tracetest can be found in the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).

## Configure Tracetest to Use Jaeger as a Trace Data Store

Configure Tracetest to be aware that it has to fetch trace data from Jaeger.

Tracetest uses [Jaeger's gRPC Protobuf/gRPC QueryService](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.42/deployment/#query-service--ui) on port `16685` to fetch trace data.

## Connect Tracetest to Jaeger with the Web UI

In the Web UI, (1) open Settings, and, on the (2) Trace Ingestion tab, (3) select Jaeger. If you are using Docker like in the screenshot below, use the service name as the hostname with port `16685` like this:

```
jaeger:16685
```

## Connect Tracetest to Jaeger with the CLI

Or, if you prefer using the CLI, you can use this file config.

```yaml
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: jaeger
  type: jaeger
  default: true
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:16685
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

Proceed to run this command in the terminal, and specify the file above.

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f my/data-store/file/location.yaml
```
