Tracetest fetches traces from [Sumo Logic's API](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/tracing/).

:::tip
Examples of configuring Tracetest can be found in the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).
:::

## Configure Tracetest to Use Sumo Logic as a Trace Data Store

Configure Tracetest to fetch trace data from Sumo Logic.

Tracetest uses Sumo Logic's **API** `https://api.sumologic.com` to fetch trace data.

You need to know which **Access ID**, **Access Key** you are using.

Find them in the [preferences settings](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/) in your Sumo Logic account.

:::

## Connect Tracetest to Sumo Logic with the Web UI

In the Web UI, (1) open Settings and, on the (2) Configure Data Store tab, select (3) Sumo Logic. Add the Sumo Logic **API**, your **Access ID**, and **Access Key**.

## Connect Tracetest to Sumo Logic with the CLI

If you prefer using the CLI, you can use this file config.

For gRPC:

```yaml
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Sumo Logic
  type: sumologic
  sumologic:
    url: "https://api.sumologic.com"
    accessID: "your-access-id"
    accessKey: "your-access-key"
```

:::tip
The URL for Sumo Logic changes depending on the region your Sumo Logic account is deployed on. Take a look at their [documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use) to understand more about it.
:::

Proceed to run this command in the terminal, and specify the file above.

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f my/data-store/file/location.yaml
```
