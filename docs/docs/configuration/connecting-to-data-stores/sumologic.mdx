Tracetest fetches traces from [Sumo Logic's API](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/tracing/).

## Connect Tracetest to Tempo with the CLI

If you prefer using the CLI, you can use this file config.

For gRPC:

```yaml
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Sumo Logic
  type: sumologic
  sumologic:
    url: "https://api.sumologic.com",
    accessID: "your-access-id",
    accessKey: "your-access-key"
```

:::tip
The URL for Sumo Logic changes depending on the region your Sumo Logic account is deployed on. Take a look at their [documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use) to understand more about it.
:::

Proceed to run this command in the terminal, and specify the file above.

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f my/data-store/file/location.yaml
```
