Tracetest fetches traces from [Sumo Logic's API](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/tracing/).

:::tip
Examples of configuring Tracetest can be found in the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).

## Configure Tracetest to Use Sumo Logic as a Trace Data Store

Configure Tracetest to fetch trace data from Sumo Logic.

- Tracetest uses Sumo Logic's **API** `https://api.sumologic.com/api/` to fetch trace data. Your Sumo Logic URL will differ based on which region you are using. [Here's a guide which Sumo Logic API endpoint to use](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use).

- You need to know which **Access ID**, **Access Key** you are using. [Create your ID and Key under Administration > Security > Access Keys in your Sumo Logic account](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-your-access-key).
