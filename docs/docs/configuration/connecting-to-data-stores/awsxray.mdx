If you want to use [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) as the trace data store, you can use the native connection from Tracetest to pull telemetry data directly from any region.

:::tip
Examples of configuring Tracetest with X-Ray can be found in the [`examples` folder of the Tracetest GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples).

## Configure Tracetest to Use X-Ray as a Trace Data Store

Configure Tracetest to be aware that it has to fetch trace data from X-Ray.

Tracetest uses the Golang [AWS-SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) library to pull to fetch trace data.

From the configuration page, add your AWS credentials. You can use temporary credentials by running `aws sts get-session-token`.
Lastly, you can ensure the connection is working as expected by pressing the `Test Connection` button.

## Connect Tracetest to AWS X-Ray with the CLI

Or, if you prefer using the CLI, you can use this file config.

```yaml
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: AWS X-Ray
  type: awsxray
  default: true
  awsxray:
    accessKeyId: <your-accessKeyId>
    secretAccessKey: <your-secretAccessKey>
    sessionToken: <your-session-token>
    region: "us-west-2"
```

Run this command in the terminal and specify the file above.

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f my/data-store/file/location.yaml
```
