Tracetest Agent is a lightweight, dependency-free, agent that runs locally in your development environment, or as a Docker container in your Cloud Native infrastructure.

## Start Tracetest Agent

Tracetest Agent connects to Tracetest via an API Key.

[Start Tracetest Agent](../getting-started/installation.mdx) in your environment to begin testing!

Or, [sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) and follow the instructions on the `Settings > Agent` page.

## Configure Tracetest Agent

Once started, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports `4317` and `4318` to ingest traces via `gRPC` and `HTTP` and is responsible for running tests. Read the detailed concepts [here](../concepts/agent).

:::note
Unlike with [Tracetest Core](/core/getting-started/overview.mdx), you are not required to run a dedicated [Tracetest Server](/core/configuration/server.mdx). Running Tracetest Agent and using Tracetest as the remote server requires no configuration or infrastructure management.
:::

If you are running the agent on a server and want to see detailed information about its execution, you can start the agent with the `--mode=verbose` flag:
