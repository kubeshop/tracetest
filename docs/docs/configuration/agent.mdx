Tracetest Agent is a lightweight, dependency-free, agent that runs locally in your development environment, or as a Docker container in your Cloud Native infrastructure.

Once started, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports `4317` and `4318` to ingest traces via gRCP and HTTP. Tracetest Agent connects to Tracetest via an API Key. 

Unlike with Tracetest Core, you are not required to run a dedicated Tracetest Server. Running Tracetest Agent and using Tracetest as the remote server requires no configuration or infrastructure management.

[Start Tracetest Agent](../getting-started/installation.mdx) in your environment to get started.

Or, [sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) and follow the instructions on the Agent Settings page.
