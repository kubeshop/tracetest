The Tracetest Agent enables Tracetest to access your application under test and to ingest trace data from your OpenTelemetry Collector or tracing backend. It's a lightweight, dependency-free, agent that runs in your environment as an executable, Docker container, or in your Cloud Native infrastructure.

Tracetest Agent connects to Tracetest via an API Key.

[Sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) and follow the instructions on the `Settings > Access` page.

Select `Application is in a private environment`.
