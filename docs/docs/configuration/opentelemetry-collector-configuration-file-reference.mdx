## Supported Trace Data Stores

Tracetest is designed to work with different trace data stores. To enable Tracetest to run end-to-end tests against trace data, you need to configure Tracetest to access trace data.

Currently, Tracetest supports the following data stores. Click on the respective data store to view configuration examples:

- [AWS X-Ray](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray)
- [Azure App Insights](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights)
- [Dash0](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/dash0)
- [Datadog](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/datadog)
- [Dynatrace](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/dynatrace)
- [Elastic APM](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/elasticapm)
- [Grafana Tempo](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/tempo)
- [Honeycomb](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/honeycomb)
- [Jaeger](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/jaeger)
- [Lightstep](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/lightstep)
- [New Relic](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/new-relic)
- [OpenSearch](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opensearch)

## Configure OpenTelemetry Collector to Send Traces to Jaeger

In your OpenTelemetry Collector config file, make sure to set the `exporter` to `jaeger`, with the `endpoint` pointing to your Jaeger instance on port `14250`. If you are running Tracetest with Docker, the endpoint might look like this `http://jaeger:14250`.

```yaml
# collector.config.yaml

# If you already have receivers declared, you can just ignore
# this one and still use yours instead.
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:14250
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    # You probably already have a traces pipeline, you don't have to change it.
    # Just add this one to your configuration. Just make sure to not have two
    # pipelines with the same name.
    traces/1:
      receivers: [otlp] # your receiver
      processors: [batch] # make sure to add the batch processor
      exporters: [jaeger] # your exporter pointing to your Jaeger instance
```
