# Undefined Variables

When a user runs a test or a transaction, any variables that will be needed but are not defined will be prompted for:

![Undefined Variables Modal](../img/undefined-variables-modal.png)

Undefined variables are dependent on the environment selected and whether or not the variable is defined in the current environment. Select the environment to run the test or transaction in from the dropdown list at the top right of the page:

## **Undefined Variables Use Cases**

### **Supply Variable Value at Runtime** 

A user wants a test or transaction they can run on a particular user, order id, etc that is configurable at run time. This would make running an adhoc test in an environment, even production, very easy and convenient. In this case, the user would reference the variable, but not add it to the environment. Each time they run the test or transaction, they would be prompted for the unspecified variables.

### **Supply Variable Value from a Previous Test**

A user wants to define 3 tests as part of a transaction. The first test has an output variable and this output is used by the second test. They define the first test. They then define the second test and reference the variable value that is output from the first test. 

In Tracetest, undefined variables can be used in both the UI and CLI. 

## **Undefined Variables Transaction with Multiple Tests Example**

1. Create an HTTP Pokemon list test that uses environment variables for hostname and the SKIP query parameter:

![Create Pokemon List](../img/pokeshop-list.png)

2. Within the test, create test spec assertions that use environment variables for comparators, something like: http.status_code = "${env:STATUS_CODE}":

![Create Test Spec Assertionsl](../img/create-test-spec-assertions.png)

3. Create a GRPC pokemon add test that uses environment variables for hostname and pokemon name:

![Create GRPC](../img/create-grpc.png)

4. Create an output from this test for the SKIP variable that could come from anywhere in the trace:

![Test Output](../img/test-output.png)

5. Now, you can create a transaction with the two tests - first, add the list test, then the add test, and then the list test again:

![Create Transaction](../img/create-transaction.png)

6. From here you can input the values for the undefined variables and complete your trace:
