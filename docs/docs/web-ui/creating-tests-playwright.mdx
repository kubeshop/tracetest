Would you like to initiate a Tracetest test from Playwright?

Playwright can only test the UI of an application. You can only run validations against what the user would see while going through flows. Tracetest enhances this by adding trace-based testing on top of Playwright.

Creating a test with the Playwright integration is defined within your Playwright tests.

View these pages to learn how to trigger Tracetest with Playwright.
