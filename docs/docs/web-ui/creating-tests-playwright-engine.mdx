[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an open-source automation framework developed by Microsoft that enables cross-browser automation for web applications. It provides a set of APIs and libraries for automating interactions with web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

Click the Playwright Engine option to continue:

![Choose Trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/djwdcmwdz/image/upload/v1725949257/docs/app.tracetest.io_organizations_ttorg_2179a9cd8ba8dfa5_environments_ttenv_231b49e808c29e6a_tests_page_1_2_sl75n1.png)

You can choose an example test in the shared Pokeshop API Demo environment.

![Choose Example Pokemon](https://res.cloudinary.com/djwdcmwdz/image/upload/v1725951354/docs/app.tracetest.io_organizations_ttorg_2179a9cd8ba8dfa5_environments_ttenv_231b49e808c29e6a_test_create_playwrightengine_ktazl2.png)

Choose the **Pokeshop - Import** example and click **Run**.

The Playwright Testing Engine executes your testing scripts natively in the platform, by specifying three things:

- The target URL of your website (private or public).
- A JavaScript file with your tests.
- And the exported method you want to execute.

When the test finishes, you will get the following results:

- The Playwright script output.
- The trace from both the front-end UI and back-end processes.
