Would you like to initiate a Tracetest test from Artillery?

Artillery runs performance tests against your application. You can only run validations against what the output you get from the application, not whether any underlying services failed or if side-effects cause bugs. Tracetest enhances this by adding trace-based testing on top of Artillery.

Creating a test with the Artillery integration is defined within your Artillery tests.

View these pages to learn how to trigger Tracetest with Artillery.
