gRPC is used extensively in modern architectures and micro-services, so we added this very useful trigger type for creating tests in Tracetest.

👉 **Join our [shared Pokeshop API Demo environment](https://app.tracetest.io/organizations/ttorg_2179a9cd8ba8dfa5/invites/invite_760904a64b4b9dc9/accept) and try creating a Test yourself!**

![Main Screen](../img/main-screen-0.14.png)

Click the **Create** button:

![Create a Test Button](../img/create-test-button-0.14.png)

The "Create New Test" dialog appears.
Choose the kind of trigger to initiate the trace:

- HTTP Request - Create a basic HTTP request.
- gRPC Request - Test and debug your GRPC request.
- Kafka - Test consumers with Kafka messages.
- TraceID - Define your test via a TraceID.

Or, choose to use an external integration to trigger Tracetest:

- Cypress
- Playwright
- k6
- Artillary

Then, click one of the options to continue:

![Choose Trigger](../img/choose-trigger-0.16.png)

In this example, gRPC Request has been chosen.

![Choose Example](../img/choose-gRPC-0.16.png)

Input the **Name** and **Trigger** details or select one of the example provided in the drop down:

![Choose Example Pokemon](../img/choose-example-pokemon-gRPC-0.16.png)

The **Pokemon - Import** example has been chosen.

![Choose Example Pokemon](../img/choose-example-pokemon-import-gRPC-0.16.png)

Add any additional information and click **Run**:

![Create Test](../img/provide-addl-information-gRPC-0.16.png)

When the test is finished, you will get the following results:

Please visit the [Test Results](../web-ui/test-results.mdx) document for an explanation of viewing the results of a test.
