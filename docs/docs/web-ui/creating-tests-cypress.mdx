Would you like to initiate a Tracetest test from Cypress?

Cypress can only test the UI of an application. You can only run validations against what the user would see while going through flows. Tracetest enhances this by adding trace-based testing on top of Cypress.

Creating a test with the Cypress integration is defined within your Cypress tests.

View these pages to learn how to trigger Tracetest with Cypress.
