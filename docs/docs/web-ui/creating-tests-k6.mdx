Would you like to initiate a Tracetest test from k6?

k6 runs performance tests against your application. You can only run validations against what the output you get from the application, not whether any underlying services failed or if side-effects cause bugs. Tracetest enhances this by adding trace-based testing on top of k6.

Creating a test with the k6 integration is defined within your k6 tests.

View these pages to learn how to trigger Tracetest with k6.
