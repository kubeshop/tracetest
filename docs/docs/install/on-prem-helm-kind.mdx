:::note For Development Environment
This installation is meant for testing purposes only. It uses self signed certificates, so your browser will show a warning about it.
:::

:::tip For Production
For the Production-ready installation:

- [View the official Helm chart readme](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest-cloud-charts/blob/main/README.md).
- [View the official installation docs](/install/on-prem-helm).
:::

1. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on your machine. Clone the official Tracetest Helm chart.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest-cloud-charts.git
cd ./tracetest-cloud-charts
```

2. Request a **license key, [here](https://tracetest.io/on-prem-installation)**.

3. Run the setup script with a demo. Add your license key when you get prompted.

```sh
sh ./scripts/setup_kind_cluster.sh --install-demo
```

4. Add the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` file to access Tracetest.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 tracetest.localdev" >> /etc/hosts'
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 pokeshop.localdev" >> /etc/hosts'
```

This setup will configure a local kind cluster with Tracetest On-Prem and the [Pokeshop API demo](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview), with all networking and prerequisites configured to work locally. You can go to the following links:

- [`https://tracetest.localdev:30000`](https://tracetest.localdev:30000) - Access the Tracetest Web UI. You get a user and an organization created for you.
- [`https://pokeshop.localdev:30000`](https://pokeshop.localdev:30000) - Access the Pokeshop API demo to run tests.
