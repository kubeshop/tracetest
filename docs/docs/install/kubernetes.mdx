This guide explain how to install a Tracetest Agent in your Kubernetes environment. This deployment uses the Cloud-based managed Tracetest Control Plane and Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- Have a running Kubernetes cluster.
- Install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
- [Sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) and retrieve your [Tracetest Organization API Key/Token and Environment ID](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).


## Install the Tracetest Agent with Kubernetes

[Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) runs as a Kubernetes Daemonset.

```bash title="Terminal"
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/k8s/agent/deploy-agent.sh | bash -s -- default <TRACETEST_API_KEY> --environment <TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

The Tracetest Agent is running in Kubernetes and ready to accept traces.

gRPC: `http://<service-name>:4317`

HTTP: `http://<service-name>:4318/v1/traces`

:::note K8s Network
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.

To run tests against apps running on your local machine you have two options:

1. Run Tracetest Agent locally with the `tracetest start` command.
2. Add Tracetest Agent to the same network and use service name mapping. *Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest Agent service, and use `<service-name>:8080` in the URL field when creating a test.*

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`
