This guide explain how to configure Cloud-based managed Tracetest with the Tracetest CLI, and install a Tracetest Agent in your local development environment. This deployment uses the Cloud-based managed Tracetest Control Plane and Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) and retrieve your [Tracetest Organization API Key/Token and Environment ID](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).

## Install the Tracetest CLI

<GtagInstallCliTabs></GtagInstallCliTabs>

Configure the CLI to access your Cloud-based managed Tracetest account.

```bash title="Terminal"
tracetest configure -t <TRACETEST_API_KEY> --environment <TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

## Install the Tracetest Agent Locally

[Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) runs as a standalone process.

```bash title="Terminal"
tracetest start --api-key <TRACETEST_API_KEY> --environment <TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID>
```

```bash title="Expected Output"
Tracetest start launches a lightweight agent. It enables you to run tests and collect traces with Tracetest.
Once started, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports 4317 and 4318 to ingest traces via gRCP and HTTP.

 INFO  Running in desktop mode...
 INFO  Starting Agent with name...
Agent is started! Leave the terminal open so tests can be run and traces gathered from this environment.
You can:
> Open Tracetest in a browser to this environment
  (Experimental) Open Dashboard
  Stop this agent
```

Tracetest Agent runs tests and ingests traces. It exposes OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for trace ingestion. In this example you can trigger tests against apps running in your local environment on `localhost`, and export traces from your local apps to `localhost` as well.

To ingest traces in this example with Tracetest Agent use these URLs:

- gRPC: `http://localhost:4317`
- HTTP: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`
