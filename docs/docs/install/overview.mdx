:::info Prerequisites
- Access to an app that is exporting OpenTelemetry distributed traces.
- If you don't have one, [**try our live demos**](/getting-started/try-live-demos) to evaluate Tracetest.
- Or, read our [guide how to configure OpenTelemetry](/getting-started/no-otel) yourself.
:::

Tracetest supports two deployment models.

- [Cloud-based managed](https://app.tracetest.io/)
- [Enterprise self-hosted](https://tracetest.io/on-prem-installation)

With both options Tracetest Agents run in your infrastructure on the same network as your application under test. Tracetest Agents are test runners and trace ingestors. You can choose to run the control plane / dashboard self-hosted or let us manage it in Cloud-based managed Tracetest, it's up to you. Check out the [deployment architecture](/install/deployment-architecture) to learn more.
