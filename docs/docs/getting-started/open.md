# Opening Tracetest

...


:::info
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest container. To run tests against apps running on your local machine, add them to the same network and use service name mapping instead. Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest service, and use `service-name:8080` in the URL field when creating an app.

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`
