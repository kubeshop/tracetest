Tracetest has two shared demo environments which allow you to view, create, and run tests. Playing with these is a great way to get started learning to use Tracetest. *Hint, hint... it is really easy!* ðŸ˜‰

## OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

ðŸ‘‰ **Join our [shared OpenTelemetry Demo environment](https://app.tracetest.io/organizations/ttorg_2179a9cd8ba8dfa5/invites/invite_646747b36e9ee487/accept).**

The OpenTelemetry team maintains an official [demo of the OpenTelemetry project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo).

Once you join, check out the [OpenTelemetry Demo store docs](/live-examples/opentelemetry-store/overview/) to learn about:

- [System architecture](/live-examples/opentelemetry-store/overview#system-architecture)
- [Use cases](/live-examples/opentelemetry-store/overview#use-cases)
