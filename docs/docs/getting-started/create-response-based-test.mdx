You can create tests in two ways:

1. Programmatically, in YAML
2. Visually, in the Web UI

Once started, Tracetest Agent executes tests in the environment where it is running and returns the response from triggered tests. This is how you run basic response-based testing.

## Create a Test Programatically with the CLI

Create a file called `ping-google.yaml`.

```yaml title="ping-google.yaml"
type: Test
spec:
  name: Ping Google
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      method: GET
      url: https://google.com
      headers:
      - key: Content-Type
        value: application/json
```

Run it with the CLI.

```bash title="Terminal"
tracetest run test -f ./ping-google.yaml
```

## Create a Test Visually with the Web UI

Create a test in the Web UI by opening your Tracetest Account. Click the Create button, and select HTTP.

Enter `https://google.com` as the URL, and click Run.
