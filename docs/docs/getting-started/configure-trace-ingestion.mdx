[Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) runs alongside your apps, in the same environment/network, to do two things:

1. Run tests against your apps.
2. Ingest traces from your apps.

This page explains (2), how to ingest traces into Tracetest Agent to enable trace-based testing.

## Enable Trace Ingestion with an OTLP Endpoint

Create a file called `trace-ingestion.yaml`.

```yaml title="trace-ingestion.yaml"
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Opentelemetry Collector pipeline
  type: otlp
  default: true
```

And, run it with the CLI.

```bash title="Terminal"
tracetest apply datastore -f ./trace-ingestion.yaml
```

Or, use the Web UI. Go to Settings > Trace Ingestion, and toggle "Enable Trace Ingestion" to on.

Select OpenTelemetry.

## Configure Trace Exporters to Send Traces to Tracetest Agent

Once configured, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for trace ingestion. Configure your trace exporters to send traces to the Tracetest Agent OTLP endpoint.

<Tabs groupId="installation">
<TabItem value="cli" label="Tracetest CLI" default>

With the Tracetest Agent running locally, the trace ingestion OTLP endpoints will be:

- gRPC: `http://localhost:4317`
- HTTP: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

With the Tracetest Agent running in Docker with `tracetest-agent` as the service name, the trace ingestion OTLP endpoints will be:

- gRPC: `http://tracetest-agent:4317`
- HTTP: `http://tracetest-agent:4318/v1/traces`

:::note Docker Network
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.

Add Tracetest Agent to the same network and use service name mapping. *Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest Agent service, and use `<service-name>:8080` in the URL field when creating a test.*

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`

<TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

With the Tracetest Agent running in Kubernetes with `tracetest-agent` as the service name, the trace ingestion OTLP endpoints will be:

- gRPC: `http://tracetest-agent.default.svc.cluster.local:4317`
- HTTP: `http://tracetest-agent.default.svc.cluster.local:4318/v1/traces`

:::note K8s Network
Make sure to use the correct `<service-name>` if you edit the Tracetest Agent `service` name.

Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.
Make sure to run tests using the internal Kubernetes service networking eg: `http://<your-app-service-name>.default.svc.cluster.local:port`.

<TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">

With the Tracetest Agent running in Kubernetes with `agent` as the Helm `<release-name>`, the trace ingestion OTLP endpoints will be:

- gRPC: `http://agent-tracetest-agent:4317`
- HTTP: `http://agent-tracetest-agent:4318/v1/traces`

:::note K8s Network
Make sure to use the correct `<service-name>` if you edit the Tracetest Agent Helm chart `<release-name>` name.

Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.
Make sure to run tests using the internal Kubernetes service networking eg: `http://<your-app-service-name>.default.svc.cluster.local:port`.

In the following example you can use: `http://pokeshop-pokemon-api:8081`.
