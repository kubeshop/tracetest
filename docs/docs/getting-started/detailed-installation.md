# Detailed Instructions on Installing Tracetest Using the CLI

Tracetest has a command line interface (CLI) which includes an **install wizard** that helps to install the Tracetest server into Docker or Kubernetes. The CLI can also be used to run tests, download or upload tests, and manage much of the capability of Tracetest.

## Installing the Tracetest Server via the CLI

Use the CLI's install wizard to install a Tracetest server locally using Docker Compose or to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster.

The wizard installs all the tools required to set up the desired environment and creates all the configurations, tailored to your case.

Every time we release a new version of Tracetest, we generate binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Supporting both amd64, and ARM64 architectures, in `tar.gz`, `deb`, `rpm` and `exe` formats.

You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/releases/latest).

### Linux/MacOS

Tracetest CLI can be installed automatically using the following script:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeshop/tracetest/main/install-cli.sh | bash
```

It works for systems with Homebrew, `apt-get`, `dpkg`, `yum`, `rpm` installed, and if no package manager is available, it will try to download the build and install it manually.

You can also manually install it with one of the following methods.

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew install kubeshop/tracetest/tracetest
```

#### APT

```sh
# requirements for our deb repo to work
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates

# add repo
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/tracetest/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list

# update and install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tracetest
```

#### YUM

```sh
# add repository
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/tracetest.repo
[tracetest]
name=Tracetest
baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/tracetest/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# install
sudo yum install tracetest --refresh
```

### Windows
Download one of the files from the latest tag, extract to your machine, and then [add the tracetest binary to your PATH variable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41895179)

## Install a Tracetest Server for Development with the CLI

This guide will help you get Tracetest running using the Tracetest CLI.

### Prerequisites

:::info
Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) installed.
:::

:::info
In this quick start, OpenTelemetry Collector is used to send traces directly to Tracetest. If you have an existing trace data source, [read here](../configuration/overview.md).
:::

### 1. Run the `server install` Command
Once you've installed the CLI you can install a Tracetest server by running:

```bash
tracetest server install
```

```text title="Expected output:"
████████ ██████   █████   ██████ ███████ ████████ ███████ ███████ ████████ 
   ██    ██   ██ ██   ██ ██      ██         ██    ██      ██         ██

Version: v0.10.1


Hi! Welcome to the TraceTest server installer. I'll help you set up your TraceTest server by asking you a few questions
and configuring your system with all the requirements, so you can start TraceTesting right away!

To get more info about TraceTest, you can check our docs at https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/

If you have any issues, please let us know by creating an issue (https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose)
or reach us on Discord https://discord.gg/6zupCZFQbe


How do you want to run TraceTest? [type to search]: 
> Using Docker Compose
  Using Kubernetes
```

### 2. Select Docker Compose

This prompts you to select if you want to get either a Docker Compose or Kubernetes setup generated for you.

Select `Using Docker Compose`.

```text title="Expected output:"

How do you want to run TraceTest?: 
  > Using Docker Compose


-> Let's check if your system has everything we need

✔ docker already installed
✔ docker is ready
✔ docker compose already installed

-> Your system is ready! Now, let's configure TraceTest

Do you have OpenTelemetry based tracing already set up, or would you like us to install a demo tracing environment and app? [type to search]: 
> I have a tracing environment already. Just install Tracetest
  Just learning tracing! Install Tracetest, OpenTelemetry Collector and the sample app.
```

After choosing this option, the installer will check if your Docker installation is ok on your machine and will proceed to the next step.

### 3. Select a default installation or an installation with sample app.

In this step, you can choose to install just Tracetest alone or install it with a sample app. By seeing the following options:

```text title="Expected output:"
Do you have OpenTelemetry based tracing already set up, or would you like us to install a demo tracing environment and app? [type to search]: 
> I have a tracing environment already. Just install Tracetest
  Just learning tracing! Install Tracetest, OpenTelemetry Collector and the sample app.
```

By choosing any option, this installer will create a `tracetest` directory in the current directory and will add a `docker-compose.yaml` file to it.
If you choose the first one, the `docker-compose.yaml` will have only Tracetest and its dependencies. By choosing the second, a sample app called [Pokeshop](../live-examples/pokeshop/overview.md) will be installed with Tracetest, allowing you to create some tests against it in the future. 

For demonstration purposes, we will choose `Just learning tracing! Install Tracetest, OpenTelemetry Collector and the sample app.` option.

### 4. Finish the installation.

Tracetest will proceed with the installation and show how to start it.

```text title="Expected output:"
-> Thanks! We are ready to install TraceTest now

 SUCCESS  Install successful!

To start tracetest:

        docker compose -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml  up -d

Then, use your browser to navigate to:

  http://localhost:11633

Happy TraceTesting =)
```

### 5. Start Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

```bash title="Condensed expected output from the Tracetest container:"
Starting tracetest ...
...
2022/11/28 18:24:09 HTTP Server started
...
```

### 8. Open the Tracetest Web UI

Open [`http://localhost:11633`](http://localhost:11633) in your browser.

Create a [test](../web-ui/creating-tests.md).

:::info
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest container. To run tests against apps running on your local machine, add them to the same network and use service name mapping instead. Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest service, and use `service-name:8080` in the URL field when creating an app.

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`
