# Getting Started with Tracetest Using Docker Compose

This guide will help you get Tracetest running using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

:::info
Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
:::

:::info
In this quick start, OpenTelemetry Collector is used to send traces directly to Tracetest. If you have an existing trace data source, [read here](../configuration/overview.md).
:::

## 1. Create a Docker Compose Config

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest.config.yaml:/app/config.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.59.0
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
```

## 2. Create a Tracetest Config File

Create a `tracetest.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
postgresConnString: "host=postgres user=postgres password=postgres port=5432 sslmode=disable"

poolingConfig:
  maxWaitTimeForTrace: 10s
  retryDelay: 1s

googleAnalytics:
  enabled: true

telemetry:
  dataStores:
    otlp:
      type: otlp
  exporters:
    collector:
      serviceName: tracetest
      sampling: 100 # 100%
      exporter:
        type: collector
        collector:
          endpoint: otel-collector:4317

server:
  telemetry:
    dataStore: otlp
    exporter: collector
    applicationExporter: collector
```

The `postgresConnString` will configure Tracetest to connect to the Postgres service. The `telemetry.dataStores` defines that the trace data store will be through `otlp` because it's expecting to receive traces from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## 3. Create an OpenTelemetry Collector Config File

Create a `collector.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 5s
    policies:
      - name: tracetest-spans
        type: trace_state
        trace_state: { key: tracetest, values: ["true"] }
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/1:
    endpoint: tracetest:21321 # This sends traces to Tracetest
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/1:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [tail_sampling, batch]
      exporters: [otlp/1]
```

## 4. Start Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

```bash title="Condensed expected output from the Tracetest container:"
Starting tracetest ...
...
2022/11/28 18:24:09 HTTP Server started
...
```

## 5. Open the Tracetest Web UI

Open your browser on [`http://localhost:11633`](http://localhost:11633).

Create a [test](../web-ui/creating-tests.md).

:::info
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest container. To run tests against apps running on your local machine, add them to the same network and use service name mapping instead. Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest service, and use `service-name:8080` in the URL field when creating an app.

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`
