Tracetest is a cloud-native application, designed to run in the cloud. Get started with Tracetest in two ways:

- [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) - Use managed infrastructure with collaboration for teams.
- [Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core](/core/getting-started/overview) - Deploy it in your own infrastructure with Docker or Kubernetes.

:::note
*Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest is coming soon. [Book a call](https://dub.sh/tracetest-demo) to get into early access.*

## Getting Started with Tracetest Managed Platform

**We recommend using [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)**. It's the easiest way to test microservices and distributed apps with OpenTelemetry distributed traces. Tracetest provides managed infrastructure, [collaboration for teams](/concepts/environments), [RBAC](/concepts/roles-and-permissions), [organizations](/concepts/organizations), [dependency-free config](/concepts/agent), [agentless serverless config](/concepts/cloud-agent), and much more.

Get started with the installation guide below, tailored for microservice and distributed app developers. You may find it insightful even if you have [one of many other supported use cases](/examples-tutorials/recipes).

```mdx-code-block

```

## Getting Started with Tracetest Core

Tracetest Core is a cloud-native application, packaged and distributed as a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.

```mdx-code-block
