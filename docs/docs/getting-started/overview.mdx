Tracetest is a cloud-native application, packaged and distributed as a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.

We recommend using our managed platform for [Tracetest](https://cloud.tracetest.io/), because it's the easiest way to build and test with OpenTelemetry. Tracetest includes features such as collaboration for teams and comes with a free tier for development.

Alternatively, you can run Tracetest Core on your own infrastructure with Docker or Kubernetes.
