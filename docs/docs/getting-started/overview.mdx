Tracetest is a cloud-native application, designed to run in the cloud. Get started in three ways.

- **[Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) (Free to get started!)**: Use managed infrastructure with collaboration for teams, and additional features on top of Tracetest Core.
- **Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest**: Same experience as with Cloud-based Managed Tracetest but self-hosted in your own infrastructure. **[Request a demo](https://dub.sh/tracetest-demo) or [contact us](https://tracetest.io/contact) to get a quote!**
- **[Hobby Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core](/core/getting-started/overview)**: Deploy a hobby instance in your own infrastructure with Docker or Kubernetes. Not suitable for production workloads.

## Cloud-based Managed Tracetest

**We recommend using [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)**. It's the easiest way to test microservices and distributed apps with OpenTelemetry distributed traces. Tracetest provides managed infrastructure, [collaboration for teams](/concepts/environments), [RBAC](/concepts/roles-and-permissions), [organizations](/concepts/organizations), [dependency-free config](/concepts/agent), [agentless serverless config](/concepts/cloud-agent), and much more.

Get started with the installation guide below, tailored for microservice and distributed app developers. You may find it insightful even if you have [one of many other supported use cases](/examples-tutorials/recipes).

## Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest

If your organization requires you to keep data on-prem, you can use Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest and deploy it in your own infrastructure. It contains the same features as Cloud-based Managed Tracetest.

We recommend you try [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) as a trial, and reach out to us to [request a demo](https://dub.sh/tracetest-demo) for Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest.

### Features Available in Cloud-based Managed Tracetest and Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest

#### All Tracetest Core features, plus...

- The usual cloud-based managed capability: SSO, accounts, organizations, roles, ability to run multiple environments, sharing, and security.
- Additional test triggers: Cypress, Playwright, k6, Artillery, with more coming soon.
- Additional test automation options: GitHub Actions, `@tracetest/client` npm module, with more coming soon.
- Grouped test runs: Organize multiple tests into a single "test run group". These tests can then be executed simultaneously in parallel. The system will wait for all tests in the group to complete before delivering a consolidated "pass/fail" outcome. This functionality is particularly beneficial for halting CI/CD processes if any test in the group fails.
- Test coverage overview: "Run" tab to monitor actively running tests with extensive meta tagging and filtering.
- Public + private access, with Tracetest Agent or Tracetest Cloud Agent.
- Secrets management: Obfuscate values in variable sets.
- Synthetic monitoring: Run your existing trace-based tests and test suites on a schedule and get alerted with your favorite alerting tools when they fail.
- Playwright engine trigger: Run your existing Playwright tests as part of the Tracetest platform and enhance them with trace-based testing.

## Hobby Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core

Tracetest Core is a cloud-native application, packaged and distributed as a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.
