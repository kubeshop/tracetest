```mdx-code-block
import {TracetestCoreGettingStartedGuideCardsRow, TracetestCloudGettingStartedGuidesRow, TracetestOnPremGettingStartedGuidesRow} from '@site/src/components/GettingStartedGuide';
```

There are three ways to set up your development environment and install Tracetest. Testing locally with Tracetest CLI installed on your computer and using Cloud-based Managed Tracetest for test and trace artifact storage is the most common scenario.

```mdx-code-block
<TracetestCloudGettingStartedGuidesRow />
<TracetestOnPremGettingStartedGuidesRow />
<TracetestCoreGettingStartedGuideCardsRow />
```

## Cloud-based Managed Tracetest and Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest

**We recommend using [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)**. It's the easiest way to test web apps, APIs, microservices, and distributed apps with OpenTelemetry distributed traces. Tracetest provides managed infrastructure, [collaboration for teams](/concepts/environments), [RBAC](/concepts/roles-and-permissions), [organizations](/concepts/organizations), [dependency-free config](/concepts/agent), [agentless serverless config](/concepts/cloud-agent), and much more.

If your organization requires you to keep data on-prem, you can use **[Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/on-prem-installation) and deploy it in your own infrastructure**. It contains the same features as Cloud-based Managed Tracetest.

You can view [examples and many other supported use cases, here](/examples-tutorials/recipes).

### Features Available in Cloud-based Managed Tracetest and Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest

#### All Tracetest Core features, plus...

- The usual cloud-based managed capability: SSO, accounts, organizations, roles, ability to run multiple environments, sharing, and security.
- Additional test triggers: Cypress, Playwright, k6, Artillery, with more coming soon.
- Additional test automation options: GitHub Actions, `@tracetest/client` npm module, with more coming soon.
- Grouped test runs: Organize multiple tests into a single "test run group". These tests can then be executed simultaneously in parallel. The system will wait for all tests in the group to complete before delivering a consolidated "pass/fail" outcome. This functionality is particularly beneficial for halting CI/CD processes if any test in the group fails.
- Test coverage overview: "Run" tab to monitor actively running tests with extensive meta tagging and filtering.
- Public + private access, with Tracetest Agent or Tracetest Cloud Agent.
- Secrets management: Obfuscate values in variable sets.
- Synthetic monitoring: Run your existing trace-based tests and test suites on a schedule and get alerted with your favorite alerting tools when they fail.
- Playwright engine trigger: Run your existing Playwright tests as part of the Tracetest platform and enhance them with trace-based testing.

## Hobby Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core
