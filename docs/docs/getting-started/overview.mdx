Tracetest is a cloud-native application, designed to run in the cloud. Get started in three ways.

- **[Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) (Free to get started!)**: Use managed infrastructure with collaboration for teams, and additional features on top of Core.
- **Enterprise Self-hosted Tracetest (Coming soon...)**: Same experience as with Cloud-based Managed Tracetest but self-hosted in your own infrastructure. **[Book a call](https://dub.sh/tracetest-demo) to get into early access.**
- **[Hobby Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core](/core/getting-started/overview)**: Deploy a hobby instance in your own infrastructure with Docker or Kubernetes. Not suitable for production workloads.

## Getting Started with Tracetest Managed Platform

**We recommend using [Cloud-based Managed Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)**. It's the easiest way to test microservices and distributed apps with OpenTelemetry distributed traces. Tracetest provides managed infrastructure, [collaboration for teams](/concepts/environments), [RBAC](/concepts/roles-and-permissions), [organizations](/concepts/organizations), [dependency-free config](/concepts/agent), [agentless serverless config](/concepts/cloud-agent), and much more.

Get started with the installation guide below, tailored for microservice and distributed app developers. You may find it insightful even if you have [one of many other supported use cases](/examples-tutorials/recipes).

```mdx-code-block
<TracetestGettingStartedGuideCardsRow />
```

## Getting Started with Tracetest Core

Tracetest Core is a cloud-native application, packaged and distributed as a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.

```mdx-code-block
<TracetestCoreGettingStartedGuideCardsRow />
```
