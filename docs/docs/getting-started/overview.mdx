Tracetest is a cloud-native application, packaged and distributed a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.

You can get started with Tracetest in one of two ways.

- Docker
- Kubernetes

We recommend using the Tracetest CLI to install a Tracetest Server in your environment.

Alternatively, you can run Tracetest with Helm or set up a custom Docker Compose file.

```mdx-code-block
import {GettingStartedGuideCardsRow} from '@site/src/components/GettingStartedGuide';

<GettingStartedGuideCardsRow />
```
