This page showcases getting started with [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) by using the Tracetest CLI and Tracetest Agent.

## Install the Tracetest CLI

## Install the Tracetest Agent

[Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) runs as a standalone process. It runs either locally on your machine or as a container. Once started, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for trace ingestion. It executes tests in the environment where it is running and returns the response from triggered tests.

[Sign in to Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/), and get your [Tracetest Agent API Key](/configuration/agent).

The Tracetest Agent is running in Docker and ready to accept traces.

gRPC: `http://<service-name>:4317`

HTTP: `http://<service-name>:4318/v1/traces`

:::note
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.

To run tests against apps running on your local machine you have two options:

1. Run Tracetest Agent locally with the `tracetest start` command.
2. Add Tracetest Agent to the same network and use service name mapping. *Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest Agent service, and use `<service-name>:8080` in the URL field when creating a test.*

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`

## Install Tracetest On-Prem

:::note
This installation is meant for testing purposes only. It uses self signed certificates, so your browser will show a warning about it.
:::

1. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on your machine. Clone the official Tracetest Helm chart.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest-cloud-charts.git
cd ./tracetest-cloud-charts
```

2. Request a **licence key, [here](https://tracetest.io/on-prem-installation)**.

3. Run the setup script with a demo. Add your license key when you get prompted.

```sh
sh ./scripts/setup_kind_cluster.sh --install-demo
```

4. Add the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` file to access Tracetest.

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 tracetest.localdev" >> /etc/hosts'
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 pokeshop.localdev" >> /etc/hosts'
```

This setup will configure a local kind cluster with Tracetest On-Prem and the [Pokeshop API demo](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview), with all networking and prerequisites configured to work locally. You can go to the following links:

- [`https://tracetest.localdev:30000`](https://tracetest.localdev:30000) - Access the Tracetest Web UI. You get a user and an organization created for you.
- [`https://pokeshop.localdev:30000`](https://pokeshop.localdev:30000) - Access the Pokeshop API demo to run tests.
