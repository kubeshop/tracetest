This page showcases getting started with [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) by using the Tracetest CLI and Tracetest Agent.

## Install the Tracetest CLI

## Install the Tracetest Agent

[Tracetest Agent](../concepts/agent) runs as a standalone process. It runs either locally on your machine or as a container. Once started, Tracetest Agent exposes OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for trace ingestion. It executes tests in the environment where it is running and returns the response from triggered tests.

tracetest start
</CodeBlock>

The Agent will start and open a browser. Sign in to Tracetest.

Once signed in, return to the terminal.

Agent is started! Leave the terminal open so tests can be run and traces gathered from this environment (env_name).

The Tracetest Agent is running and ready to accept traces.

The Tracetest Agent is running in Docker and ready to accept traces.

gRPC: `http://<service-name>:4317`

HTTP: `http://<service-name>:4318/v1/traces`

:::note
Running a test against `localhost` will resolve as `127.0.0.1` inside the Tracetest Agent container.

To run tests against apps running on your local machine you have two options:

1. Run Tracetest Agent locally with the `tracetest start` command.
2. Add Tracetest Agent to the same network and use service name mapping. *Example: Instead of running an app on `localhost:8080`, add it to your Docker Compose file, connect it to the same network as your Tracetest Agent service, and use `<service-name>:8080` in the URL field when creating a test.*

You can reach services running on your local machine using:

- Linux (docker version < 20.10.0): `172.17.0.1:8080`
- MacOS (docker version >= 18.03) and Linux (docker version >= 20.10.0): `host.docker.internal:8080`
