If you're already building something with Tracetest, explore these Recipes. They're short, self-contained, and runnable solutions to popular use cases.

## Streams and Message Queues

These recipes show how to trigger Tracetest test runs with message queues like Kafka.

- [Testing Kafka in a Go API with OpenTelemetry](./recipes/testing-kafka-go-api-with-opentelemetry-tracetest.mdx)

## Trace Data Stores

These recipes show integrations with trace data stores and tracing vendors/providers.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

This integration point uses the OpenTelemetry Collector as a router to send trace data to Tracetest.

- [Sending traces directly to Tracetest from a Node.js app using OpenTelemetry Collector](./recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store.mdx)
- [Sending traces with manual instrumentation directly to Tracetest from a Node.js app using OpenTelemetry Collector](./recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store-with-manual-instrumentation.md)
- [Sending traces with manual instrumentation directly to Tracetest from a Python app using OpenTelemetry Collector](./recipes/running-python-app-with-opentelemetry-collector-and-tracetest.md)

### OpenTelemetry Collector + Tracing Vendors

This integration point uses the OpenTelemetry Collector as a router to send trace data to both Tracetest and tracing vendors/providers.
