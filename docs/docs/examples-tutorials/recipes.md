# Recipes

These recipes will show you the best practices for using Tracetest.

## Trace Data Stores

These recipes show integrations with trace data stores and tracing vendors/providers.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

This integration point uses the OpenTelemetry Collector as a router to send trace data to both Tracetest and tracing vendors/providers.
