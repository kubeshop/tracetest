[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

## Sample Go APIs with OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure two Go APIs to communicate via Kafka. They use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, Jaeger as a trace data store, and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing.

```

## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Create an [environment](/concepts/environments).
- Create an [environment token](/concepts/environment-tokens).
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](/configuration/agent).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Node.js Quickstart with Manual Instrumentation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Log into the [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
3. This example is configured to use the Jaeger Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you will be utilizing to run this example is also configured to use the Jaeger Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, Jaeger, `endpoint: jaeger:16685`, Save.
4. Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [API key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your `.env` file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.
5. Run `docker compose up -d`.
6. Run tests from the Tracetest Web UI by accessing the producer URL `http://producer-api:8080/publish`, and by using a Kafka trigger on URL `kafka:9092` of the consumer.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The quick start Kafka + Go project is built with Docker Compose and contains the Tracetest Agent, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry Collector and a both Go apps.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Go apps, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry Collector, and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Go Producer API

The Go API is a simple HTTP server, [contained in the `main.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/main.go).

The OpenTelemetry tracing is [contained in the `./telemetry/telemetry.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/telemetry/telemetry.go).
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector, and forwarded to Jaeger.

Traces will be sent to either the `grpc` endpoint. The hostname and port as seen in the env section of the `producer-api` in the `docker-compose.yaml` is:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317`

The server starts by running the `main.go` file as you can see [in the `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/Dockerfile).

[The `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/3caff14247d745035f7cbbb68a7208f6da4e51fd/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/docker-compose.yaml#L3C3-L21C1) for the Go Producer API.

```yaml
  producer-api:
    image: quick-start-producer-api
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: ./producer-api
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317
      - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=producer-api
      - KAFKA_BROKER_URL=kafka:9092
      - KAFKA_TOPIC=messaging
    depends_on:
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
      kafka:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Go Consumer Worker

The Go API is a simple HTTP server, [contained in the `main.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/consumer-worker/main.go).

The OpenTelemetry tracing is [contained in the `./telemetry/telemetry.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/consumer-worker/telemetry/telemetry.go).
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector, and forwarded to Jaeger.

Traces will be sent to either the `grpc` endpoint. The hostname and port as seen in the env section of the `consumer-worker` in the `docker-compose.yaml` is:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317`

The server starts by running the `main.go` file. As you can see [in the `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/consumer-worker/Dockerfile).

[The `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/f5d7cb6747813838623d1a61424788e12f21cece/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/docker-compose.yaml#L22-L39) for the Go Producer API.

```yaml
  consumer-worker:
    image: quick-start-consumer-worker
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: ./consumer-worker
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317
      - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=consumer-worker
      - KAFKA_BROKER_URL=kafka:9092
      - KAFKA_TOPIC=messaging
    depends_on:
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
      kafka:
        condition: service_healthy
      producer-api:
        condition: service_started
```

## Running the Go Apps, Kafka, and Tracetest

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
TRACETEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>"
```

To start the full setup, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This example is configured to use the Jaeger Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you're using is configured to use the Jaeger Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, Jaeger, `endpoint: jaeger:16685`, Save.

Or, use [the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference) and [the `tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/tracetest/tracing-backend.yaml) sets the tracing backend to Jaeger, and tells Tracetest Agent to poll for traces from Jaeger.

```yaml title="./tracetest/tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml"
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Jaeger
  type: jaeger
  default: true
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:16685
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest/tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml
```

## Run Tracetest Tests

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://producer-api:8080/publish` URL in your test creation, because your Go app and Tracetest Agent are in the same network. And, use the [Kafka trigger](http://localhost:3000/web-ui/creating-tests-kafka) for the Consumer Worker.

Here are two sample tests you can get started with quickly.

ðŸ‘‰ [Testing the Consumer](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/test-consumer.yaml)

ðŸ‘‰ [Testing the Producer](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/test-producer.yaml)

To trigger tests in the CLI, first [install the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference), [configure it](/cli/configuring-your-cli), and [run a test](/cli/running-tests).

From the root of the quick start directory, run:

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest run test -f ./test-producer.yaml
tracetest run test -f ./test-consumer.yaml
```

```mdx-code-block

  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Hobby Open-Source Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains one `docker-compose.yaml` file that configures Tracetest, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry Collector, and both Go apps.

### 1. Go APIs

The `docker-compose.yaml` file references two Go apps, and one Kafka stream.

- Producer API: Builds the `./producer-api/Dockerfile`
- Consumer Worker: Builds the `./consumer-worker/Dockerfile`

The producer publishes a message to Kafka when receiving a POST request to the `/publish` endpoint.

The consumer accepts a message through Kafka.


### 2. Tracetest

The `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `jaeger:4317` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `jaeger` service, where the port `4317` is the port where Jaeger accepts traces.

## Go Producer API

The Go API is a simple HTTP server, [contained in the `main.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/main.go).

The OpenTelemetry tracing is [contained in the `./telemetry/telemetry.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/telemetry/telemetry.go).
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector, and forwarded to Jaeger.

Traces will be sent to either the `grpc` endpoint. The hostname and port as seen in the env section of the `producer-api` in the `docker-compose.yaml` is:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317`

The server starts by running the `main.go` file.

As you can see [in the `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/Dockerfile).

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine as builder
ENV GO111MODULE=on
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache git

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod ./
COPY go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ./bin/main .

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/bin/main .
CMD ["./main"]
```

And, [the `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/3caff14247d745035f7cbbb68a7208f6da4e51fd/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/docker-compose.yaml#L3C3-L21C1) for the Go Producer API.

```yaml
  producer-api:
    image: quick-start-producer-api
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: ./producer-api
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317
      - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=producer-api
      - KAFKA_BROKER_URL=kafka:9092
      - KAFKA_TOPIC=messaging
    depends_on:
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
      kafka:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Go Consumer Worker

The Go API is a simple HTTP server, [contained in the `main.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/main.go).

The OpenTelemetry tracing is [contained in the `./telemetry/telemetry.go` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/producer-api/telemetry/telemetry.go).

```yaml
  producer-api:
    image: quick-start-producer-api
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: ./producer-api
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

    depends_on:
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
      kafka:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` configures four services more including Tracetest.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [**Jaeger**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) - Open source, distributed tracing platform. Monitor and troubleshoot workflows in complex distributed systems.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:${TAG:-latest}
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provisioning.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provisioning.yaml
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
      jaeger:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60
    environment:
      TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.59.0
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
    ports:
      - 4317:4317
    depends_on:
      jaeger:
        condition: service_started

  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 16686:16686
      - 16685:16685
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:16686"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60
```

Tracetest depends on all three services, Postgres, Jaeger, and the OpenTelemetry Collector. Both Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

[The `tracetest-config.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml) contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable
```

[The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml) provisions the trace data store and polling to store in the Postgres database. The data store is set to OTLP, meaning the traces will be stored in Tracetest itself.

```yaml
---
type: PollingProfile
spec:
  name: Default
  strategy: periodic
  default: true
  periodic:
    retryDelay: 5s
    timeout: 10m

---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Jaeger
  type: jaeger
  default: true
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:16685
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

But how are traces sent to Tracetest?

[The `collector.config.yaml` explains that](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/tracetest/collector.config.yaml). It receives traces via the `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Jaeger's OLTP endpoint `jaeger:4317`.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/1:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/jaeger]
```

## Run Both the Go Apps and Tracetest

To start both Go apps and Tracetest we will run this command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.core.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://producer-api:8080/publish` URL in your test creation, because your Go app and Tracetest are in the same network.

Here are two sample tests you can get started with quickly.

ðŸ‘‰ [Testing the Consumer](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/test-consumer.yaml)

ðŸ‘‰ [Testing the Producer](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-go-and-kafka/test-producer.yaml)
