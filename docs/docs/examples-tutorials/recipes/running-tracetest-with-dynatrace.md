# Running Tracetest With Dynatrace

:::note
[Check out the source code on GitHub here.](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/tracetest-dynatrace)
:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) is a unified Observability and security platform that allows you to monitor and secure your full stack on one AI-powered data platform. From infrastructure and application observability to realtime security analytics and protection, digital experience monitoring and business analytics. All underpinned by a composable app-based platform with a custom Observability-driven workflow engine.

## OpenTelemetry Demo `v1.3.0` with Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a simple sample app on how to configure the [OpenTelemetry Demo `v1.3.0`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) to use [Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing and [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) as a trace data store.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this sample app! Additionally, you will need a Dynatrace account and an API token. Sign up for a [free Dynatrace trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial).

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. OpenTelemetry Demo

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `.env` file in the root directory are for the OpenTelemetry Demo.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for setting up Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `tracetest` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling OpenTelemetry traces and trace-based testing with Tracetest, as well as routing all traces the OpenTelemetry Demo generates to Dynatrace.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network, defined by the `networks` section on each file, and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `tracetest:4317` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `tracetest` service, where port `4317` is the port where Tracetest accepts traces.

## OpenTelemetry Demo

The [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) is a sample microservice-based app with the purpose to demo how to correctly set up OpenTelemetry distributed tracing.

Read more about the OpenTelemetry Demo [here](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/announcing-opentelemetry-demo-release/).

The `docker-compose.yaml` contains 14 services for the demo and 3 supporting dependent services.

To start the OpenTelemetry Demo **by itself**, run this command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the OpenTelemetry Demo. Open up `http://localhost:8084` to make sure it's working. But, you're not sending the traces anywhere.

Let's fix this by configuring Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector to forward trace data to both Dynatrace and Tracetest.

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with three services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data. To support sending traces to Dynatrace, we are using the [`contrib` version](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib), which contains vendor-related code.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
```

Tracetest depends on both Postgres and the OpenTelemetry Collector. Both Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

To start both the OpenTelemetry Demo and Tracetest we will run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up
```

The `tracetest-config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance and telemetry exporter. The exporter is set to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

```yaml
# tracetest-config.yaml

---
postgres:
  host: tt-postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable

        collector:
          endpoint: otel-collector:4317

server:
  telemetry:
    exporter: collector
    applicationExporter: collector
```

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file contains the setup of the demo APIs that Tracetest can use as an example for tests, the polling profiles that say how Tracetest should fetch traces from the data store and the configuration for the data store, in our case, Dynatrace.

```yaml

### Sending Traces to Tracetest and Dynatrace

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Tracetest's OTLP endpoint `tracetest:4317` in one pipeline, and to Dynatrace in another.

Make sure to add your Dynatrace API Key to the `otlp` exporter (needs the `openTelemetryTrace.ingest` permission).

```yaml

## Run Both the OpenTelemetry Demo App and Tracetest

To start both OpenTelemetry and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up
```

:::note Heads up!
Please note starting the demo for the first time will take a few minutes.
:::

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and [start creating tests in the Web UI](https://docs.tracetest.io/web-ui/creating-tests)! Make sure to use the endpoints within your Docker network like `http://frontend:8084/` when creating tests.

This is because your OpenTelemetry Demo and Tracetest are in the same network.

> Note: View the `demo` section in the `tracetest.config.yaml` to see which endpoints from the OpenTelemetry Demo are available for running tests.

Here's a sample of a failed test run, which happens if you add this assertion:

```css
attr:tracetest.span.duration  < 10ms
```

![](../img/dynatrace-failed-test.png)

Increasing the duration to a more reasonable `500ms` will make the test pass.

![](../img/dynatrace-successful-test.png)

## Run Tracetest Tests with the Tracetest CLI

First, [install the CLI](https://docs.tracetest.io/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-cli).
Then, configure the CLI:

```bash
tracetest configure --endpoint http://localhost:11633
```

Once configured, you can run a test against the Tracetest instance via the terminal.

Check out the `http-test.yaml` file.

```yaml
# http-test.yaml

type: Test
spec:
  id: JBYAfKJ4R
  name: OpenTelemetry Shop - List Products
  description: List Products available on OTel shop
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://frontend:8084/api/products
      method: GET
      headers:
      - key: Content-Type
        value: application/json
  specs:
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Tracetest trigger"]
    assertions:
    - attr:tracetest.response.status   =   200
    - attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  10ms
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="rpc" name="grpc.hipstershop.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts"]
    assertions:
    - attr:rpc.grpc.status_code = 0
  - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="rpc" name="hipstershop.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts"
      rpc.system="grpc" rpc.method="ListProducts" rpc.service="hipstershop.ProductCatalogService"]
    assertions:
    - attr:rpc.grpc.status_code = 0
```

This file defines a test the same way you would through the Web UI.

To run the test, run this command in the terminal:

```bash
tracetest run test -f ./http-test.yaml
```

This test will fail just like the sample above due to the `attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  10ms` assertion.

```bash
✘ OpenTelemetry Shop - List Products (http://localhost:11633/test/JBYAfKJ4R/run/1/test) - trace id: b9db3e805490f6e1d9aff7c48100d367
	✘ span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Tracetest trigger"]
		✘ #bf9abd7861371975
			✔ attr:tracetest.response.status   =   200 (200)
			✘ attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  10ms (1.3s) (http://localhost:11633/test/JBYAfKJ4R/run/1/test?selectedAssertion=0&selectedSpan=bf9abd7861371975)
	✔ span[tracetest.span.type="rpc" name="grpc.hipstershop.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts"]
		✔ #52a4bd4cbace9c4b
			✔ attr:rpc.grpc.status_code = 0 (0)
	✔ span[tracetest.span.type="rpc" name="hipstershop.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts" rpc.system="grpc" rpc.method="ListProducts" rpc.service="hipstershop.ProductCatalogService"]
		✔ #533d2199d7e26437
			✔ attr:rpc.grpc.status_code = 0 (0)

	✘ Required gates
		✔ analyzer-score
		✘ test-specs
```

If you edit the duration as in the Web UI example above, the test will pass!

## View Trace Spans Over Time in Dynatrace

All distributed traces (whether generated by OpenTelemetry or the OneAgent) are available in Dynatrace in the distributed traces app.

![](../img/dynatrace-distributed-traces-app.png)

You can also drill down into a particular trace.

![](../img/dynatrace-trace-drilldown.png)

The combination of Dynatrace and Tracetest is extremely powerful. Ingest your traces to Dynatrace for long term storage at planetary scale and encourage your developers to incorporate trace-based testing into their workflows with Tracetest.
