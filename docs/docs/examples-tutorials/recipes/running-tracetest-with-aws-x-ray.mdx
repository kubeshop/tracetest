[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) provides a complete view of requests as they travel through your application and filters visual data across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs and more with no-code and low-code motions.

## Node.js App with AWS X-Ray (Node.js SDK) and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start guide on how to configure a Node.js app to use instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use AWS X-Ray as the trace data store and a Node.js app to generate the telemetry data.

- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](/configuration/agent).

**AWS Account**:

- Sign up to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the AWS X-Ray Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Log into the [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
3. Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [API key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your `.env` file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.
4. Fill out the AWS credentials in the `.env` file. You can [create credentials by following this guide](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray).
5. Run `docker compose -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d`.
6. This example is configured to use the AWS X-Ray Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you're using to run this example is configured to use the AWS X-Ray Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, AWS X-Ray, Save. Or, use the CLI as explained below.
7. Run tests from the Tracetest Web UI by accessing the app with the URL `http://app:3000/http-request/`.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.agent.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app, [X-Ray Daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html), and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in [the `index.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray/src/index.js).

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<YOURAWS_SESSION_TOKEN>"
AWS_REGION="<YOUR_AWS_REGION>"
TRACETEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>"
TRACETEST_API_TOKEN="<YOUR_TRACETEST_TOKEN>"
```

The X-Ray tracing is contained in the `index.js` file. Traces will be sent to AWS X-Ray via the X-Ray Daemon.

## Configuring AWS X-Ray

Configure [AWS X-Ray as a Tracing Backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray) in Tracetest.

Get temporary credentials.

```bash
aws sts get-session-token
```

```json title="Output"
{
  "Credentials": {
    "AccessKeyId": "<yourkeyid>",
    "SecretAccessKey": "<youraccesskey>",
    "SessionToken": "<yoursessiontoken>",
    "Expiration": "2024-05-23T21:01:38+00:00"
  }
}
```

Edit the `tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml`.

```yaml title="tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml"
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: awsxray
  type: awsxray
  awsxray:
    accessKeyId: <your-accessKeyId>
    secretAccessKey: <your-secretAccessKey>
    sessionToken: <your-session-token>
    region: "<your-region>"
```

```bash
tracetest config -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml
```

## Run the Node.js App, X-Ray Daemon, and Tracetest Agent with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.agent.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray/docker-compose.agent.yaml) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray/Dockerfile) in the root directory contain the Node.js app.

The [`docker-compose.agent.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray/docker-compose.agent.yaml) also contains the Tracetest Agent and X-Ray Daemon.

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d
```

This will start the Node.js app and Tracetest Agent.

## Run Tracetest Tests

1. Open [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/).
2. [Configure AWS X-Ray as a tracing backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray) if you have not already as explained above.
3. Start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:3000/http-request/` URL in your test creation. 
4. To trigger tests in the CLI, first [install the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference), [configure it](/cli/configuring-your-cli), and [run a test](/cli/running-tests). From the root of the quick start directory, run:

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest run test -f ./test-api.yaml
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Hobby Open-Source Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

And a set of AWS credentials to connect Tracetest to the cloud API.

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose.

### 1. Node.js App

The `Dockerfile` in the root directory is for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `tracetest.provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `root` directory are for the setting up the Node.js App, Tracetest and [X-Ray Daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html).

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. For example, `xray-daemon:2000` in the `src/index.js` will map to the `xray-daemon` service, where the port `2000` is the port where the X-Ray Daemon accepts telemetry data.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `src/index.js` file.

It is instrumented using [AWS X-Ray SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs.html) sending the initial data to the Daemon that will be pushing the telemetry data to the AWS service.

The key following is the instrumentation section from the `src/index.js` file.

```js
const AWSXRay = require("aws-xray-sdk");
const XRayExpress = AWSXRay.express;
const express = require("express");

AWSXRay.setDaemonAddress("xray-daemon:2000");

// Capture all AWS clients we create
const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require("aws-sdk"));
AWS.config.update({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION || "us-west-2",
});

// Capture all outgoing https requests
AWSXRay.captureHTTPsGlobal(require("https"));
const https = require("https");

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(XRayExpress.openSegment("Tracetest"));
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm start
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY ./src/package*.json ./

RUN npm install
COPY ./src .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` includes three other services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**AWS X-Ray Daemon**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html) - is a software application that listens for traffic on UDP port 2000, gathers raw segment data, and relays it to the AWS X-Ray API. The daemon works in conjunction with the AWS X-Ray SDKs and must be running so that data sent by the SDKs can reach the X-Ray service.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:${TAG:-latest}
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest.provision.yaml
        target: /app/provisioning.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provisioning.yaml
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      xray-daemon:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

  xray-daemon:
    image: amazon/aws-xray-daemon:latest
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
      AWS_REGION: ${AWS_REGION}
    ports:
      - 2000:2000
```

Tracetest depends on Postgres and the x-ray daemon. Tracetest requires config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `root` directory and the respective config files.

The `tracetest.config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable
```

The `tracetest.provision.yaml` file defines the trace data store, set to AWS X-Ray, meaning the traces will be stored in X-Ray and Tracetest will fetch them from X-Ray when running tests.

But how does Tracetest fetch traces?

Tracetest uses the Golang [AWS-SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) library to pull to fetch trace data.

```yaml
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: awsxray
  type: awsxray
  awsxray:
    accessKeyId: <your-accessKeyId>
    secretAccessKey: <your-secretAccessKey>
    sessionToken: <your-session-token>
    region: "us-west-2"
```

How do traces reach AWX X-Ray?

The application code in the `src/index.js` file uses the native AWS SDK X-Ray library which sends telemetry data to the X-Ray Daemon to be processed and then sent to the configured AWS X-Ray SaaS.

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`. Open it and start creating tests!
Make sure to use the `http://app:3000/` URL in your test creation because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.
