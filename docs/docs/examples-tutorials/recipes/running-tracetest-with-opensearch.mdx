:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications licensed under Apache 2.0. OpenSearch started in 2021 as a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana, with development led by AWS.

## Sample Node.js App with OpenSearch, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use OpenSearch as the trace data store and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to OpenSearch.

## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. Node.js App

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `data-prepper:21890` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `data-prepper` service, where the port `21890` is the port where the Data Prepper accepts traces. And, `http://opensearch:9200` in the `tracetest-provision.yaml` will map to the `opensearch` service and port `9200` where Tracetest will fetch trace data from OpenSearch.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files, respectively.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: 'http://otel-collector:4317' }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})
sdk.start()
```

Depending on which of these you choose, traces will be sent to either the `grpc` or `http` endpoint.

The hostnames and ports for these are:

- GRPC: `http://otel-collector:4317`
- HTTP: `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains just one service for the Node.js app.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

How do traces reach OpenSearch?

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then it exports them to the Data Prepper that will parse the trace data and send it to OpenSearch. Data Prepper uses the endpoint `data-prepper:21890`.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/2:
    endpoint: data-prepper:21890
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/2]

```

## Running the Tests

### The Test File

Check out the `resources/test.yaml` file.

```yaml
# resources/test.yaml
type: Test
spec:
  id: W656Q0c4g
  name: Test API
  description: Test the App.
  pollingProfile: jBPzxDCSg
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://app:8080
      method: GET
      headers:
        - key: Content-Type
          value: application/json
  specs:
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /" http.target="/" http.method="GET"]
      assertions:
        - attr:http.status_code  =  200
        - attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  500ms
```

To run the test, run this command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose run tracetest-run
```

This will:
1. Start the Node.js app, the OpenTelemetry Collector, and send the traces to Signoz.
2. Start the Tracetest Agent.
3. Configure the tracing backend and create tests in your environment.
4. Run the tests.
