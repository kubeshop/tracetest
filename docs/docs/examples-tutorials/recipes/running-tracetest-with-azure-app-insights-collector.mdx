[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) is an extension of Azure Monitor and provides application performance monitoring (APM) features. APM tools are useful to monitor applications from development, through test, and into production in the following ways:

- Proactively understand how an application is performing.
- Reactively review application execution data to determine the cause of an incident.

[OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) - The official OpenTelemetry Distribution for packages outside of the core collector.

## Node.js App with Azure Application Insights, OpenTelemetry Collector and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start guide on how to configure a Node.js app to use instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Azure App Insights as the trace data store, the OpenTelemetry Collector to process and route the telemetry data and a Node.js app to generate it.

- Create an Application Insights app and get a [Instrumentation Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Azure Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Log into the [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
3. Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [API key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your `.env` file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.
4. Run `docker compose up -d`.
5. This example is configured to use the Azure Application Insights Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you're using to run this example is configured to use the Application Insights Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, Azure Application Insights, Save. Or, use the CLI as explained below.
6. Run tests from the Tracetest Web UI by accessing the app with the URL `http://app:8080/`.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains the [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app, Elasticsearch, Elastic APM server, OpenTelemetry Collector, and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in [the `app.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights/src/app.js).

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
TRACETEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>"
```

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.js` file. Traces will be sent to Azure Application Insights.

[The `tracing.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector/src/tracing.js) will send traces to the Azure Application Insights endpoint.

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file. As seen in the `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node -r ./tracing.js app.js"
},
```

## Configuring Azure Application Insights

Create an Application Insights resource in your Azure account. Copy the Instrumentation Key.
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djwdcmwdz/image/upload/v1716403679/docs/portal.azure.com__quickstart_true_1_i1upqy.png)

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
INSTRUMENTATION_KEY="<YOUR_APP_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY>"
```

:::note
[Read the Azure Application Insights tracing backend configuration guide to learn more.](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights)
:::

Configure Azure Application Insights as a Tracing Backend in Tracetest:

```yaml title="tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml"
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  id: current
  name: azureappinsights
  type: azureappinsights
  azureappinsights:
    connectionType: collector
    useAzureActiveDirectoryAuth: false
```

```bash
tracetest config -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml
```

## Run the Node.js App and OpenTelemetry Collector with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector/docker-compose.yaml) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector/Dockerfile) in the root directory contain the Node.js app.

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector/docker-compose.yaml) also contains the Tracetest Agent and OpenTelemetry Collector.

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the Node.js app and Tracetest Agent.

## Run Tracetest Tests

1. Open [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/).
2. [Configure Azure Application Insights as a tracing backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/azure-app-insights) if you have not already as explained above.
3. Start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation. 
4. To trigger tests in the CLI, first [install the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference), [configure it](/cli/configuring-your-cli), and [run a test](/cli/running-tests). From the root of the quick start directory, run:

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest run test -f ./test-api.yaml
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Hobby Open-Source Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

And the [App Insights Instrumentation Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) from your instance.

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose.

### 1. Node.js App

The `Dockerfile` and the `docker-compose.yaml` in the root directory is for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `tracetest.provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up the Node.js App and Tracetest.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `src/index.js` file.

It is instrumented using the [Official OpenTelemetry Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/sdk-node) wrapping the application code to send telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The following is the instrumentation code from the `src/tracing.js` file.

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: 'http://otel-collector:4317' }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  serviceName: 'tracetest-azure-app-insights-collector'
})
sdk.start()
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm start
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY ./src/package*.json ./

RUN npm install
COPY ./src .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` includes three other services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) - The official Open Telemetry Distribution for packages outside of the core collector.

```yaml

      - type: bind
        source: tracetest/tracetest.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provision.yaml
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
    environment:
      INSTRUMENTATION_KEY: ${INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}
    ports:
      - 4317:4317
networks:
  default:
    name: _default
```

Tracetest depends on Postgres and requires config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `root` directory and the respective config files.

The `tracetest.config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable
```

The `tracetest.provision.yaml` file defines the trace data store, set to Azure App Insights using the collector connection, meaning the traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry collector to be processed and routed to both Tracetest and the Azure cloud.

But how does Tracetest fetch traces?

The OpenTelemetry collector is configured with the `azuremonitor` and the `otlp/tracetest` exporter and sending telemetry data to both the Azure Cloud and Tracetest.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  azuremonitor:
    instrumentation_key: ${INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}
  otlp/tracetest:
    endpoint: tracetest:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/tracetest:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/tracetest]
    traces/appinsights:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [azuremonitor]
```

The `tracetest/tracetest.provision.yaml` file defines the trace data store, set to the Azure App Insights with the `collector` as connection type.

```yaml
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: azureappinsights
  type: azureappinsights
  azureappinsights:
    connectionType: collector
    useAzureActiveDirectoryAuth: false
```

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml -f ./tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`. Open it and start creating tests!
Make sure to use the `http://app:3000/` URL in your test creation because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.
