:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) is a cloud-based machine data analytics company focusing on security, operations and BI use-cases. It provides log management and analytics services that use machine-generated big data.

## Node.js App with Sumo Logic, OpenTelemetry, and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Sumo Logic as the trace data store, and the Sumo Logic distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Sumo Logic.


## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).

**Sumo Logic Account**:

- Sign up to Sumo Logic
- Create a Sumo Logic [installation token](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/)
- Create a Sumo Logic [`accessID` and `accessKey`](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-an-access-key)

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Sumo Logic Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/quick-start-sumologic-nodejs
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Fill out the [TRACETEST_TOKEN and ENVIRONMENT_ID](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token) details by editing your `.env` file.
4. Fill out the [SUMOLOGIC_INSTALLATION_TOKEN](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/), [SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_ID and SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_KEY](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-an-access-key) details by editing your `.env` file.
3. Run `docker compose run tracetest-run`.
4. Follow the links in the output to view the test results.


Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
# Get the required information here: https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token

TRACETEST_TOKEN="<YOUR_TRACETEST_TOKEN>"
TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID="<YOUR_ENV_ID>"

# https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/
SUMOLOGIC_INSTALLATION_TOKEN="<YOUR_SUMOLOGIC_INSTALLATION_TOKEN>"

# https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-an-access-key
SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_ID="<YOUR_SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_ID>"
SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR_SUMO_LOGIC_ACCESS_KEY>"

```

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files.

Choosing the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file will send traces to Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector's `GRPC` endpoint.

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file. As seen in the `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "app-with-grpc-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
},
```

## Run the Node.js App and Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-sumologic-nodejs/docker-compose.yaml) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-sumologic-nodejs/Dockerfile) in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service for the Node.js app, one service for the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector, and one service for Tracetest Agent.

[The `collector.config.yaml` configures the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-sumologic-nodejs/collector.config.yaml). It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Sumo Logic via the Sumo Logic `extension` and an `installation_token`.

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose run tracetest-run
```

This will start the Node.js app and Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector and send the traces to Sumo Logic.

## Run Tracetest Tests

This will:
1. Start the Node.js app, the OpenTelemetry Collector, and send the traces to Sumo Logic.
2. Start the Tracetest Agent.
3. Configure the tracing backend and create tests in your environment.
4. Run the tests.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation, because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.
