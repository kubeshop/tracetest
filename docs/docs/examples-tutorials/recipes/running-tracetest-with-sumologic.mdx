[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) is a cloud-based machine data analytics company focusing on security, operations and BI use-cases. It provides log management and analytics services that use machine-generated big data.

## Node.js App with Sumo Logic, OpenTelemetry, and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Sumo Logic as the trace data store, and the Sumo Logic distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Sumo Logic.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store">
  <TabItem value="Tracetest" label="Tracetest" default>
```

## Prerequisites

You can run this example with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Project Structure

The project contains [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/main), and a Node.js app.

### 1. Tracetest Agent

Install and run Tracetest Agent locally.

```bash title=Terminal
tracetest start
```

Once started, Tracetest Agent will:

- Expose OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for trace ingestion.
- Be able to trigger test runs in the environment where it is running.
- Be able to connect to a trace data store that is not accessible outside of your environment.

Configure Sumo Logic as a Tracing Backend:

```yaml title=tracetest.datastore.yaml
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Sumo Logic
  type: sumologic
  sumologic:
    # The URL will differ based on your location. View this
    # docs page to figure out which URL you need:
    # https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use
    url: "https://api.sumologic.com/api/"
    # Create your ID and Key under Administration > Security > Access Keys
    # in your Sumo Logic account:
    # https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-your-access-key
    accessID: "your-access-id"
    accessKey: "your-access-key"
```

:::note Configure Sumo Logic API and Access
- Your Sumo Logic URL will differ based on which region you are using. [Here's a guide which Sumo Logic API endpoint to use](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use).
- [Create your ID and Key under Administration > Security > Access Keys in your Sumo Logic account](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-your-access-key).
:::

```bash
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest.datastore.yaml
```

### 2. Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files.
Traces will be sent to Tracetest Agent.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  // OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT is passed into "new OTLPTraceExporter" automatically
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter(),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})
sdk.start()
```

Choosing the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file will send traces to Tracetest Agent's `GRPC`.

Configure it an environment variable:
- Running in Docker: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

## Run the Node.js App and Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector with Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

As you can see, the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service for the Node.js app and one service for the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317

  otel-collector:
    image: public.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector:0.75.0-sumo-0
    volumes:
      - ./collector.config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml
```

Traces sent to Sumo Logic from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `collector.config.yaml` configures the OpenTelemetry Collector. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Sumo Logic via the Sumo Logic `extension` and an `installation_token`.

:::note Configure Sumo Logic Installation Token
View the [Sumo Logic docs here](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/) to learn more about installation tokens.
:::

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  sumologic:

extensions:
  sumologic:
    installation_token: <your-sumologic-installation-token>

service:
  extensions: [sumologic]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [sumologic]
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app and Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector and send the traces to Sumo Logic.

## Run Tracetest Tests

1. Open [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)
2. [Configure Sumo Logic as a trace data store](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/sumologic) if you have not already as explained in ["1. Tracetest Agent"](#1-tracetest-agent).
3. Start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://localhost:8080/` URL in your test creation.

    Alternatively, you can import this test as a quick start!

    ```yaml
    type: Test
    spec:
      id: W656Q0c4g
      name: Test API
      description: Test the App.
      trigger:
        type: http
        httpRequest:
          url: http://localhost:8080
          method: GET
          headers:
          - key: Content-Type
            value: application/json
      specs:
      - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /" http.target="/" http.method="GET"]
        assertions:
        - attr:http.status_code  =  200
        - attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  500ms
    ```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. Node.js App
The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest Core
The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest.config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up Tracetest.

The `tracetest` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling trace-based testing with Tracetest.

### Docker Compose Network
All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `app:8080` will map to the `app` service.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  // OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT is passed into "new OTLPTraceExporter" automatically
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter(),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})
sdk.start()
```

Choosing the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file will send traces to Tracetest Agent's `GRPC`.

Configure it an environment variable:
- Running in Docker: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317`

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

As you can see, the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service for the Node.js app and one service for the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317

  otel-collector:
    image: public.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector:0.75.0-sumo-0
    volumes:
      - ./collector.config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml
```

Traces sent to Sumo Logic from the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `collector.config.yaml` configures the OpenTelemetry Collector. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Sumo Logic via the Sumo Logic `extension` and an `installation_token`. 

:::note Configure Sumo Logic Installation Token
View the [Sumo Logic docs here](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens/) to learn more about installation tokens.
:::

```yaml title="collector.config.yaml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  sumologic:

extensions:
  sumologic:
    installation_token: <your-sumologic-installation-token>

service:
  extensions: [sumologic]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [sumologic]
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app and Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector and send the traces to Sumo Logic.

Let's add trace-based testing by configuring Tracetest.

## Tracetest Core

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with two services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**Tracetest Core**](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml title="./tracetest/docker-compose.yaml"
version: "3"
services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provisioning.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provisioning.yaml
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

```

Tracetest Core depends on both Postgres and the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector from the root `docker-compose.yaml`. Tracetest Core requires config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest Core we will run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up
```

The `tracetest-config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest Core to the Postgres instance.

```yaml title="tracetest-config.yaml"
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable

```

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file provisions the trace data store and polling to store in the Postgres database. The data store is set to Sumo Logic, meaning the Tracetest Core will fetch traces from Sumo Logic when tests are run.

You'll need to set Sumo Logic:

- URL
- Access ID
- Access Key

:::note Configure Sumo Logic API and Access
- Your Sumo Logic URL will differ based on which region you are using. [Here's a guide which Sumo Logic API endpoint to use](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/api/getting-started/#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use).
- [Create your ID and Key under Administration > Security > Access Keys in your Sumo Logic account](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/#create-your-access-key).
- View the [Sumo Logic configuration docs](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/sumologic) for guidance.
:::

```yaml title="tracetest-provision.yaml"
---
type: PollingProfile
spec:
  name: Default
  strategy: periodic
  default: true
  periodic:
    retryDelay: 5s
    timeout: 10m

---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Sumo Logic
  type: sumologic
  sumologic:
    url: "https://api.sumologic.com/api/"
    accessID: "your-access-id"
    accessKey: "your-access-key"    
```

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up
```

This will start your Tracetest Core instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation, because your Node.js app and Tracetest Core are in the same network.
