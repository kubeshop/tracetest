:::note
[Check out the source code on GitHub here.](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/quick-start-tyk)
:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Tyk Gateway](https://tyk.io/) is an open-source API gateway and management platform designed to help developers control and manage their APIs. It serves as an intermediary layer between client applications and backend services, providing functionalities like authentication, rate limiting, access control, analytics, and traffic management.

## Why is this important?

Testing Distributed Services behind API Gateways has been a pain point for years. Not having visibility into the infrastructure and not knowing where a test fails causes the MTTR to be higher than for other tools. Including OpenTelemetry in your stack, allows you to expose telemetry from the tools you use like Tyk Gateway and your services that you can use for both production visibility and trace-based testing.

This sample shows how to run integration tests against a Node.js API behind Tyk Gateway, using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and Tracetest.

The Node.js Services will fetch data from an external API, transform the data, and insert it into a Postgres table. This particular flow has two failure points that are difficult to test.

1. Validating that an external API request from the worker function is successful.
2. Validating that the Postgress insert operation is successful.

## Prerequisites

**Tyk Gateway Example:**

Clone the [Tracetest GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest) to your local machine, and open the quick start tyk quick start example app.

```bash title=Terminal
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest.git
cd tracetest/examples/quick-start-tyk
```

**Tracetest Account**:

- Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
- Log into **the** [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
- This example is configured to use the OpenTelemetry Collector. Ensure the environment you will be utilizing to run this example is also configured to use the OpenTelemetry Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, OpenTelemetry, and Save.
- Configure your environment to use [the agent](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent), then click the Settings link, and from the Agent tab select the "Run Agent Locally" option.
- Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [agent api key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your .env file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.

## Project Structure

This is a Docker Compose project you can find the setup in the `docker-compose.yml` file

### 1. The Tyk Gateway

In the `docker-compose.yml` file you can find the Tyk Gateway setup.

```yaml title=docker-compose.yml
# Tyk Gateway
tyk-gateway:
  image: tykio/tyk-gateway:v5.2.1
  ports:
    - 8080:8080
  environment:
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER=grpc
    - TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=otel-collector:4317
  volumes:
    - ./deployments/tyk-gateway/apps:/opt/tyk-gateway/apps
    - ./deployments/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf
  depends_on:
    - tyk-redis

tyk-redis:
  image: redis:6.0.4
  volumes:
    - tyk-redis-data:/data
```

Adding the configuration for OpenTelemetry to the Tyk Gateway is as simple as setting the environment variables `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENABLED`, `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_EXPORTER`, and `TYK_GW_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`.

You can find the Tyk Gateway apps and configuration in the `deployments/tyk-gateway` file.

```yaml title=deployments/tyk-gateway/apps/pokeshop-demo.json
{
  "name": "pokeshop",
  "api_id": "1",
  "org_id": "default",
  "active": true,
  "use_keyless": false,
  "detailed_tracing": true,
  "definition": { "location": "header", "key": "version" },
  "auth": { "auth_header_name": "authorization" },
  "version_data": { "not_versioned": true, "versions": { "Default": { "name": "Default" } } },
  "proxy":
    { "listen_path": "/", "target_url": "http://api:8081/", "strip_listen_path": true, "preserve_host_header": true },
}
```

### 2. Tracetest

The tracetest setup is composed by the `tracetest-e2e` and the `tracetest-agent` services under the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yaml title=docker-compose.yml
# Tracetest x Playwright
tracetest-e2e:
  build: .
  command: npm test
  environment:
    - POKESHOP_DEMO_URL=${POKESHOP_DEMO_URL}
    - TRACETEST_API_TOKEN=${TRACETEST_API_TOKEN}
    - TYK_AUTH_KEY=${TYK_AUTH_KEY}
  depends_on:
    tracetest-agent:
      condition: service_started
    api:
      condition: service_healthy
    worker:
      condition: service_started
    tyk-gateway:
      condition: service_started

tracetest-agent:
  environment:
    TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}
    TRACETEST_API_KEY: ${TRACETEST_AGENT_API_KEY}
    TRACETEST_SERVER_URL: ${TRACETEST_SERVER_URL}
  image: kubeshop/tracetest-agent:latest
```

### 3. Services under Test

As a testing ground, the example uses Tracetest's own Pokeshop Demo APP which includes the `api` and `worker` services.

```yaml title=docker-compose.yml
# Demo services

# pokeshop demo services
postgres:
  image: postgres:14
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    POSTGRES_DB: postgres
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U $$POSTGRES_USER -d $$POSTGRES_DB"]
    interval: 1s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 60

cache:
  image: redis:6
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
    interval: 1s
    timeout: 3s
    retries: 60

queue:
  image: rabbitmq:3.12
  restart: unless-stopped
  healthcheck:
    test: rabbitmq-diagnostics -q check_running
    interval: 1s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 60

api:
  image: kubeshop/demo-pokemon-api:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  pull_policy: always
  environment:
    REDIS_URL: cache
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres?schema=public
    RABBITMQ_HOST: queue
    POKE_API_BASE_URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2
    COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT: http://otel-collector:4317
    NPM_RUN_COMMAND: api
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:8081"]
    interval: 1s
    timeout: 3s
    retries: 60
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    cache:
      condition: service_healthy
    queue:
      condition: service_healthy

worker:
  image: kubeshop/demo-pokemon-api:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  pull_policy: always
  environment:
    REDIS_URL: cache
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres?schema=public
    RABBITMQ_HOST: queue
    POKE_API_BASE_URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2
    COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT: http://otel-collector:4317
    NPM_RUN_COMMAND: worker
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    cache:
      condition: service_healthy
    queue:
      condition: service_healthy
```

## Set up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.template` and create a `.env` file in the same directory. Add token and Cloud Agent endpoint.

```txt title=.env
TRACETEST_API_TOKEN=<my_token_with_engineer_access>
TRACETEST_AGENT_API_KEY=<my_agent_api_key>
POKESHOP_DEMO_URL=http://tyk-gateway:8080
TYK_AUTH_KEY=28d220fd77974a4facfb07dc1e49c2aa

```

## The Tracetest End To End Script

The `playwright/home.spec.ts` file contains the script that will execute the trace-based tests against the Pokeshop App proxied by a tyk endpoint.

### Steps Executed by the Script

1. Create a new key in the Tyk Gateway.
2. Create a new test definition in Tracetest (using the async import service from the Pokeshop Demo).
3. Run the Playwright Test.
4. Report back the results.

```typescript title=playwright/home.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { getKey } from "./auth";
import Tracetest, { Types } from "@tracetest/playwright";

const { TRACETEST_API_TOKEN = "" } = process.env;

let tracetest: Types.TracetestPlaywright | undefined = undefined;

test.describe.configure({ mode: "serial" });

const definition = `
type: Test
spec:
  id: UGxheXdyaWdodDogaW1wb3J0cyBhIHBva2Vtb24=
  name: "Playwright: imports a pokemon"
  trigger:
    type: playwright
  specs:
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http"] span[tracetest.span.type="http"]
      name: "All HTTP Spans: Status  code is 200"
      assertions:
      - attr:http.status_code   =   200
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="database"]
      name: "All Database Spans: Processing time is less than 100ms"
      assertions:
      - attr:tracetest.span.duration < 2s
  outputs:
    - name: MY_OUTPUT
      selector: span[tracetest.span.type="general" name="Tracetest trigger"]
      value: attr:name
`;

test.beforeAll(async () => {
  tracetest = await Tracetest({ apiToken: TRACETEST_API_TOKEN });

  await tracetest.setOptions({
    "Playwright: imports a pokemon": {
      definition,
    },
  });
});

test.beforeEach(async ({ page, context }, { title }) => {
  // sets the auth headers for the page requests
  const key = await getKey();
  await context.setExtraHTTPHeaders({
    Authorization: `Bearer ${key}`,
  });

  await page.goto("/");
  await tracetest?.capture(title, page);
});

// optional step to break the playwright script in case a Tracetest test fails
test.afterAll(async ({}, testInfo) => {
  testInfo.setTimeout(80000);
  await tracetest?.summary();
});

test("Playwright: imports a pokemon", async ({ page }) => {
  expect(await page.getByText("Pokeshop")).toBeTruthy();

  await page.click("text=Import");

  await page.getByLabel("ID").fill(Math.floor(Math.random() * 101).toString());
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "OK", exact: true }).click();
});
```

The output from the Playwright tests will show the test results with links to the Tracetest App.
