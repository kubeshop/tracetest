:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use your telemetry data generated by the OpenTelemetry tools to check and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) is a scalable, flexible, and extensible open-source software suite for search, analytics, and observability applications licensed under Apache 2.0. OpenSearch started in 2021 as a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana, with development led by AWS.

## Sample Node.js App with OpenSearch, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use OpenSearch as the trace data store and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to OpenSearch.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. Node.js App

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up Tracetest, OpenSearch and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `tracetest` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling OpenTelemetry traces and trace-based testing with Tracetest.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `data-prepper:21890` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `data-prepper` service, where the port `21890` is the port where the Data Prepper accepts traces. And, `http://opensearch:9200` in the `tracetest-provision.yaml` will map to the `opensearch` service and port `9200` where Tracetest will fetch trace data from OpenSearch.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files, respectively.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: 'http://otel-collector:4317' }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})
sdk.start()
```

Depending on which of these you choose, traces will be sent to either the `grpc` or `http` endpoint.

The hostnames and ports for these are:

- GRPC: `http://otel-collector:4317`
- HTTP: `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains just one service for the Node.js app.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app. But, you're not sending the traces anywhere.

Let's fix this by configuring Tracetest and OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with four services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [**OpenSearch**](https://opensearch.org/) - Data store and search engine.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

They will start in this order:

1. Postgres
2. OpenSearch
3. Data Prepper
4. OpenTelemetry Collector
5. Tracetest

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest
    platform: linux/amd64

      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.59.0
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
    depends_on:
      data-prepper:
        condition: service_started

  data-prepper:

    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/opensearch/opensearch-analytics.yaml:/usr/share/data-prepper/pipelines.yaml
      - ./tracetest/opensearch/opensearch-data-prepper-config.yaml:/usr/share/data-prepper/data-prepper-config.yaml
    depends_on:
      opensearch:
        condition: service_healthy

  opensearch:
    image: opensearchproject/opensearch:2.3.0
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true # along with the memlock settings below, disables swapping
      - "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m" # minimum and maximum Java heap size, recommend setting both to 50% of system RAM
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/opensearch/opensearch.yaml:/usr/share/opensearch/config/opensearch.yml
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
      nofile:
        soft: 65536 # maximum number of open files for the OpenSearch user, set to at least 65536 on modern systems
        hard: 65536
    healthcheck:
      test: curl -s http://localhost:9200 >/dev/null || exit 1
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5

```

Tracetest depends on Postgres and the OpenTelemetry Collector. The OpenTelemetry Collector depends on the Data Prepper that then depends on OpenSearch.

Both Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

OpenSearch and Data Prepper require config files to be loaded via a volume as well. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest/opensearch` directory and the respective config files. Data Prepper will receive trace data from OpenTelemetry Collector and send them along to OpenSearch.

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

The `tracetest.config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable

```

How does Tracetest fetch traces?

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file contains the data store setup, which is set to OpenSearch, meaning the traces will be stored in OpenSearch and Tracetest will fetch them from OpenSearch when running tests.

```yaml
---
type: PollingProfile
spec:
  name: Default
  strategy: periodic
  default: true
  periodic:
    retryDelay: 5s
    timeout: 10m

---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: OpenSearch
  type: opensearch
  opensearch:
    addresses:
      - http://opensearch:9200
    index: traces

```

How do traces reach OpenSearch?

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then it exports them to the Data Prepper that will parse the trace data and send it to OpenSearch. Data Prepper uses the endpoint `data-prepper:21890`.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/2:
    endpoint: data-prepper:21890
    tls:
      insecure: true
      insecure_skip_verify: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/2]

```

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation, because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.
