[Check out the source code on GitHub here.](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot)
:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) provides a complete view of requests as they travel through your application and filters visual data across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs and more with no-code and low-code motions.

[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. Part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs, libraries and agents to collect distributed traces and metrics for application monitoring.

## Node.js API with AWS X-Ray (Node.js SDK), AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start guide on how to configure a Node.js app to use instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use AWS X-Ray as the trace data store, the ADOT as a middleware and a Node.js app to generate the telemetry data.

## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/overview) docs.
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).

**AWS Account**:

- Sign up to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the AWS X-Ray Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Fill out the [TRACETEST_TOKEN and ENVIRONMENT_ID](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token) details by editing your `.env` file.
3. Fill out the AWS credentials in the `.env` file. You can [create credentials by following this guide](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray).
4. Run `docker compose run tracetest-run`.
5. Follow the links in the output to view the test results.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains the [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/install-agent), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app, [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector), and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in [the `index.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot/src/index.js).

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
# Get the required information here: https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token

TRACETEST_TOKEN="<YOUR_TRACETEST_TOKEN>"
TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID="<YOUR_ENV_ID>"

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<YOURAWS_SESSION_TOKEN>"
AWS_REGION="<YOUR_AWS_REGION>"
```

The X-Ray tracing is contained in the `index.js` file. Traces will be sent to AWS X-Ray via ADOT.

## Run the Node.js App, ADOT, and Tracetest Agent with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot/docker-compose.yaml) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot/Dockerfile) in the root directory contain the Node.js app.

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-amazon-x-ray-adot/docker-compose.yaml) also contains the Tracetest Agent and ADOT.

To run everything including Tracetest tests, run this command:

```bash
docker compose run tracetest-run
```

This will:
1. Start the Node.js app, the ADOT Collector, and send the traces to X-Ray.
2. Start the Tracetest Agent.
3. Configure the tracing backend and create tests in your environment.
4. Run the tests.
