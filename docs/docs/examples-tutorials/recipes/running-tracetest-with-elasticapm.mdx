[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) is a search, observability, and security platform. The company is famous for developing the ELK stack - ElasticSearch, Kibana, Beats and Logstash that is used by thousands of developers. Elastic offers a cloud platform, Elastic Cloud, as its commercial offering to enable observability across logs, application performance monitoring (APM), and infrastructure monitoring, real user monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring.

## Node.js App with Elasticsearch, Elastic APM and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use Elastic APM Agent with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Elastic APM and Elasticsearch as the trace data store and Elastic APM server to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Elasticsearch.

## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Elastic Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/tracetest-elasticapm-with-elastic-agent
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Fill out the [TRACETEST_TOKEN and ENVIRONMENT_ID](https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token) details by editing your `.env` file.
3. Run `docker compose run tracetest-run`.
4. Follow the links in the output to view the test results.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app, Elasticsearch, Elastic APM server, and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in [the `app.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-elasticapm-with-elastic-agent/app.js).

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
# Get the required information here: https://app.tracetest.io/retrieve-token

TRACETEST_TOKEN="<YOUR_TRACETEST_TOKEN>"
TRACETEST_ENVIRONMENT_ID="<YOUR_ENV_ID>"

# Password for the 'elastic' user (at least 6 characters)
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=changeme

# Password for the 'kibana_system' user (at least 6 characters)
KIBANA_PASSWORD=changeme

# Version of Elastic products
STACK_VERSION=8.6.0

# Set the cluster name
CLUSTER_NAME=docker-cluster

# Set to 'basic' or 'trial' to automatically start the 30-day trial
LICENSE=basic

# Port to expose Elasticsearch HTTP API to the host
ES_PORT=9200

# Port to expose Kibana to the host
KIBANA_PORT=5601

# Increase or decrease based on the available host memory (in bytes)
MEM_LIMIT=1073741824

# Project namespace (defaults to the current folder name if not set)
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=test
```

The Elastic APM tracing is contained in [the `elastic-apm-agent.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-elasticapm-with-elastic-agent/elastic-apm-agent.js). Traces will be sent to Elastic APM Server.

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file. As seen in the `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-elastic-apm-tracer":"node -r ./elastic-apm-agent.js app.js"
},
```

## Run the Node.js App, Elasticsearch and Elastic APM with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-elasticapm-with-elastic-agent/docker-compose.agent.yaml) also contains the Tracetest Agent, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic APM server.

## Run Tracetest Tests

To execute th tests it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose run tracetest-run
```

This will:
1. Start the Node.js app, the OpenTelemetry Collector, and send the traces to Elastic APM.
2. Start the Tracetest Agent.
3. Configure the tracing backend and create tests in your environment.
4. Run the tests.
