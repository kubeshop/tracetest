[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io/) is an observability solution that shows you the patterns and outliers of how users experience your code in complex and unpredictable environments.

## Node.js App with Honeycomb, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing and Honeycomb as a trace data store.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store">
  <TabItem value="Tracetest" label="Cloud-based Managed Tracetest" default>
```

## Prerequisites

**Tracetest Account**:

- Sign up to [`app.tracetest.io`](https://app.tracetest.io) or follow the [get started](/getting-started/installation) docs.
- Create an [environment](/concepts/environments).
- Create an [environment token](/concepts/environment-tokens).
- Have access to the environment's [agent API key](/configuration/agent).

**Docker**: Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest project. You can download and run the example by following these steps:

Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Node.js Quickstart:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/tracetest-honeycomb
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Log into the [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
3. This example is configured to use the Honeycomb Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you will be utilizing to run this example is also configured to use the Honeycomb Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, Honeycomb, Save.
4. Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [API key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your `.env` file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.
5. Run `docker compose -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d`.
6. Run tests from the Tracetest Web UI by accessing the app with the URL `http://app:8080/`.

Follow along with the sections below for a detailed breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The quick start Node.js project is built with Docker Compose and contains the Tracetest Agent and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.agent.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
TRACETEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>"
HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="<YOUR_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY>"
```

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files. Traces will be sent to Tracetest Agent.

Choosing [the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/tracetest-honeycomb/tracing.otel.grpc.js) will send traces to Tracetest Agent's `GRPC` endpoint.

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file. As seen in the `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "app-with-grpc-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
},
```

## Configuring Honeycomb

Configure [Honeycomb as a Tracing Backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/honeycomb) in Tracetest.

```yaml title="tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml"
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Honeycomb
  type: honeycomb
  default: true
```

```bash
tracetest config -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml
```

## Run the Node.js App, OpenTelemetry Collector, and Tracetest Agent with Docker Compose

To start the full setup, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d
```

## Run Tracetest Tests

1. Open [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/).
2. [Configure Honeycomb as a tracing backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/honeycomb) if you have not already as explained above.
3. Start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation. 
4. To trigger tests in the CLI, first [install the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference), [configure it](/cli/configuring-your-cli), and [run a test](/cli/running-tests). From the root of the quick start directory, run:

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest run test -f ./test-api.yaml
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Hobby Open-Source Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this sample app! Additionally, you will need a Honeycomb account and api key. Sign up to use Honeycomb [here](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup).

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. Node.js App

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the root directory are for the setting up Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `root` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling OpenTelemetry traces and trace-based testing with Tracetest, as well as routing all traces the Node.js App generates to Honeycomb.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. E.g. `tracetest:4317` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `tracetest` service, where the port `4317` is the port where Tracetest accepts traces.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node");
const {
  getNodeAutoInstrumentations,
} = require("@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node");
const {
  OTLPTraceExporter,
} = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc");

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: "http://otel-collector:4317" }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});
sdk.start();
```

Depending on which of these you choose, traces will be sent to either the `grpc` or `http` endpoint.

The hostnames and ports for these are:

- GRPC: `http://otel-collector:4317`
- HTTP: `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains just one service for the Node.js app.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app. But, you're not sending the traces anywhere.

Let's fix this by configuring Tracetest and OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with three services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml
version: "3.2"
services:
  tracetest:
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:${TAG:-latest}
    platform: linux/amd64
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provision.yaml
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provision.yaml
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
    environment:
      TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.68.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml

```

Tracetest depends on both Postgres and the OpenTelemetry Collector. Both Tracetest and the OpenTelemetry Collector require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

To start both the Node.js App and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

The `tracetest-config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance.

```yaml
# tracetest-config.yaml

---
postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable

```

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file contains the data store setup. The data store is set to `Honeycomb` meaning the traces will be received by Tracetest OTLP API and stored in Tracetest itself.

```yaml
# tracetest-provision.yaml
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Honeycomb
  type: honeycomb
```

**How to Send Traces to Tracetest and Honeycomb**

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Tracetest's OTLP endpoint `tracetest:4317` in one pipeline, and to Honeycomb in another.

Make sure to add your Honeycomb access token in the headers of the `otlp/ls` exporter.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 100ms

exporters:
  logging:
    logLevel: debug
  # OTLP for Tracetest
  otlp/tracetest:
    endpoint: tracetest:4317 # Send traces to Tracetest. Read more in docs here:  https://docs.tracetest.io/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector
    tls:
      insecure: true
  # OTLP for Honeycomb
  otlp/honeycomb:
    endpoint: "api.honeycomb.io:443"
    headers:
      "x-honeycomb-team": <HONEYCOMB_API_KEY>
      # Read more in docs here: https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/otel-collector/

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/tracetest:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/tracetest]
    traces/honeycomb:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logging, otlp/honeycomb]
```

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js App and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation, because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.

## Run Tracetest Tests with the Tracetest CLI

First, [install the CLI](https://docs.tracetest.io/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-cli).
Then, configure the CLI:

```bash
tracetest configure --server-url http://localhost:11633
```

Once configured, you can run a test against the Tracetest instance via the terminal.

Check out the `test-api.yaml` file.

```yaml
# test-api.yaml

type: Test
spec:
  id: W656Q0c4g
  name: http://app:8080
  description: akadlkasjdf
  trigger:
    type: http
    httpRequest:
      url: http://app:8080
      method: GET
      headers:
        - key: Content-Type
          value: application/json
  specs:
    - selector: span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /" http.target="/" http.method="GET"]
      assertions:
        - attr:http.status_code  =  200
        - attr:tracetest.span.duration  <  500ms

```

This file defines a test the same way you would through the Web UI.

To run the test, run this command in the terminal:

```bash
tracetest run test -f ./test-api.yaml
```

```bash
✔ http://app:8080 (http://localhost:11633/test/W656Q0c4g/run/2/test)
	✔ span[tracetest.span.type="http" name="GET /" http.target="/" http.method="GET"]
```
