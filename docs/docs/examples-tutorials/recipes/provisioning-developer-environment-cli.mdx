:::info Version Compatibility
The features described here are compatible with the [Tracetest CLI v1.2.0](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and above.
:::

:::note
[Check out the source code on GitHub here.](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/provisioning-developer-environment-cli)
:::

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that permits you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use the trace data generated by your OpenTelemetry tools to check and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

## Why is this important?

Developer experience is one of the key values we always push forward at Tracetest. This enables teams to have a consistent and reliable way to onboard new developers.
By using the Tracetest CLI, you can automate the process of creating a new environment for a developer joining your team.
This ensures that the developer has the necessary environment to start working on the project without any manual intervention.

## Requirements

**Tracetest CLI**:

- Download & Install the [Tracetest CLI](https://docs.tracetest.io/cli/cli-installation-reference)
- Login or Signup to your Tracetest account using the CLI with `tracetest configure`

## Run This Quckstart Example

The example below is provided as part of the Tracetest GitHub repo. You can download and run the example by following these steps:
Clone the Tracetest project and go to the Privisioning Developer Environment with CLI example directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest
cd tracetest/examples/provisioning-developer-environment-cli
```

Follow these instructions to run Provision an Environment using the example:

1. Run the `tracetest apply environment -f ./environment.yaml` command to create the environment and provision the environment.
2. Run the `tracetest list environments` command to list the environments.
3. Configure the Tracetest CLI to point the new environment by running the `tracetest configure --organization <your-org-id> --environment automated-pokeshop-demo` command.
4. Execute the test suite by running the `tracetest run -f ./resources/suites/pokeshop.yaml --vars tracetesting-vars` command.
5. Follow the link to the Tracetest UI to view the test results.

## Project Structure

The project structure for the Provisioning Developer Environment with CLI example is as follows:

```bash
environment.yaml
/resources
  /tests
    add-pokemon.yaml
    import-pokemon.yaml
    list-pokemon.yaml
  /suites
    pokeshop.yaml
  /config
    variableset.yaml
    pollingprofile.yaml
    runner.yaml
    tracing-backend.yaml
```

The Environment Definition includes a section to specify the resources that will be applied along with the environment. The resources are defined in the `/resources` directory.

```yaml title="environment.yaml"
type: Environment
spec:
  id: automated-pokeshop-demo
  name: Automated Pokeshop Demo
  agentConfiguration:
    serverless: true
  resources: ./resources
```

The resources are defined in the `/resources` directory. The resources include tests, test suites, variable sets, polling profiles, test runners, and tracing backends.

## Provisioned Resources

The example provisions the following resources:

### Polling Profile

```yaml title="resources/config/pollingprofile.yaml"

## Provisioning the Environment
After installing the Tracetest CLI and configuring it with your account, you can run the following command to provision the environment:

```bash
tracetest apply environment -f ./environment.yaml
```

## Running the Test Suite

Finally, you can run the test suite by executing the following command:

```bash
tracetest configure --environment automated-pokeshop-demo
tracetest run -f ./resources/suites/pokeshop.yaml --vars tracetesting-vars
```
