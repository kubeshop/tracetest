[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allows you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use data from distributed traces generated by OpenTelemetry to validate and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) is an open-source, high-scale distributed tracing data store. It utilizes object storage to minimize costs, allowing you to store more information at a lower cost. It is deeply integrated with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki. Grafana Tempo is also available as a paid hosted service at Grafana Cloud.

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) is a managed service offering from Grafana Labs that provides scalable and secure monitoring, visualization, and alerting for metrics, logs, and traces. It integrates seamlessly with various data sources, enabling users to create dynamic, interactive dashboards and gain insights into their system performance and reliability. With features like team collaboration, alerting, and plugins, Grafana Cloud is designed to simplify observability and help teams efficiently monitor their applications and infrastructure.

## Node.js App with Grafana Cloud Tempo, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Tempo on Grafana Cloud as the trace data store, and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Tempo.

cd tracetest/examples/quick-start-grafana-cloud-tempo-nodejs
```

Follow these instructions to run the quick start:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`.
2. Log into the [Tracetest app](https://app.tracetest.io/).
3. Fill out the [token](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/environment-tokens) and [API key](https://docs.tracetest.io/concepts/agent) details by editing your `.env` file. You can find these values in the Settings area for your environment.
4. Run `docker compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d`.
5. This example is configured to use the Grafana Tempo Tracing Backend. Ensure the environment you're using to run this example is configured to use the Grafana Tempo Tracing Backend by clicking on Settings, Tracing Backend, Grafana Tempo, Save. Or, use the CLI as explained below.
6. Run tests from the Tracetest Web UI by accessing the app with the URL `http://app:8080/`.

Follow along with the sections below for an in detail breakdown of what the example you just ran did and how it works.

## Project Structure

The project contains [Tracetest Agent](/getting-started/installation#install-the-tracetest-agent), [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main), [Grafana Tempo](https://github.com/grafana/tempo), and a Node.js app.

The `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root directory of the quick start runs the Node.js app and the [Tracetest Agent](/concepts/agent) setup.

## Configuring the Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in [the `app.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/app.js).

Configure the `.env` like shown below.

```bash
TRACETEST_API_KEY="<YOUR_TRACETEST_API_KEY>"
```

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files. Traces will be sent to Grafana Tempo.

Choosing [the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/tracing.otel.grpc.js) will send traces to OpenTelemetry Collector's `GRPC` endpoint.

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file. As seen in the `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "app-with-grpc-tracer": "node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
},
```

## Configuring OpenTelemetry Collector

Configure OpenTelemetry Collector to send traces to Grafana Cloud Tempo.

```yaml title="collector.config.yaml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
  otlp:
    endpoint: tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443
    headers:
      authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username:password>

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [logging, otlp]
```

Fill the authorization header in the `collector.config.yaml` file from your Grafana Tempo Setup. It should be encoded `base64` with the format of `username:token`. Follow [this guide to learn how](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/13/how-to-send-traces-to-grafana-clouds-tempo-service-with-opentelemetry-collector/).

## Configuring Grafana Tempo

Configure Tempo as a Tracing Backend:

```yaml title="tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml"
---
type: DataStore
spec:
  id: tempo-cloud
  name: Tempo
  type: tempo
  tempo:
    type: http
    http:
      url: https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net/tempo
      headers:
        authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username:password>
      tls: {}
```

Fill in the details of your Grafana Cloud Tempo instance by using the HTTP integration `authorization` header. It should be encoded `base64` with the format of `username:token`. Follow [this guide to learn how](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/13/how-to-send-traces-to-grafana-clouds-tempo-service-with-opentelemetry-collector/).

```bash
tracetest config -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest apply datastore -f ./tracetest-tracing-backend.yaml
```

## Run the Node.js App, OpenTelemetry Collector, and Tracetest Agent with Docker Compose

The [`docker-compose.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/docker-compose.yaml) and [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/Dockerfile) in the root directory are for the Node.js app. The `docker-compose.yaml` contains one service for the Node.js app.

The [`docker-compose.agent.yaml` file](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/docker-compose.agent.yaml) is for the Tracetest Agent and OpenTelemetry Collector.

[The `collector.config.yaml` configures the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/examples/quick-start-tempo-nodejs/collector.config.yaml). It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Tempo via the OTLP `exporter`.

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.yaml -f ./docker-compose.agent.yaml up -d
```

This will start the Node.js app the OpenTelemetry Collector and send the traces to Grafana Tempo.

## Run Tracetest Tests

1. Open [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/)
2. [Configure Tempo as a tracing backend](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/tempo) if you have not already as explained above.
3. Start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation. 
4. To trigger tests in the CLI, first [install the CLI](/cli/cli-installation-reference), [configure it](/cli/configuring-your-cli), and [run a test](/cli/running-tests). From the root of the quick start directory, run:

```bash
tracetest configure -t <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
tracetest run test -f ./test-api.yaml
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Tracetest Core" label="Hobby Open-Source Tracetest Core">
```

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine to run this quick start app!

## Project Structure

The project is built with Docker Compose. It contains two distinct `docker-compose.yaml` files.

### 1. Node.js App

The `docker-compose.yaml` file and `Dockerfile` in the root directory are for the Node.js app.

### 2. Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` file, `collector.config.yaml`, `tracetest-provision.yaml`, and `tracetest-config.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory are for the setting up Tracetest, Tempo, and the OpenTelemetry Collector.

The `tracetest` directory is self-contained and will run all the prerequisites for enabling OpenTelemetry traces and trace-based testing with Tracetest.

### Docker Compose Network

All `services` in the `docker-compose.yaml` are on the same network and will be reachable by hostname from within other services. For example, `tempo:4317` in the `collector.config.yaml` will map to the `tempo` service, where the port `4317` is the port where Tempo accepts traces. And, `tempo:9095` in the `tracetest-provision.yaml` will map to the `tempo` service and port `9095` where Tracetest will fetch trace data from Tempo.

## Node.js App

The Node.js app is a simple Express app, contained in the `app.js` file.

The OpenTelemetry tracing is contained in the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` or `tracing.otel.http.js` files, respectively.
Traces will be sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Here's the content of the `tracing.otel.grpc.js` file:

```js
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: 'http://otel-collector:4317' }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})
sdk.start()
```

Depending on which of these you choose, traces will be sent to either the `grpc` or `http` endpoint.

The hostnames and ports for these are:

- GRPC: `http://otel-collector:4317`
- HTTP: `http://otel-collector:4318/v1/traces`

Enabling the tracer is done by preloading the trace file.

```bash
node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js
```

In the `package.json` you will see two npm scripts for running the respective tracers alongside the `app.js`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "with-grpc-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.grpc.js app.js",
  "with-http-tracer":"node -r ./tracing.otel.http.js app.js"
},
```

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
npm run with-grpc-tracer
# or
npm run with-http-tracer
```

As you can see the `Dockerfile` uses the command above.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:slim
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "with-grpc-tracer" ]
```

And, the `docker-compose.yaml` contains just one service for the Node.js app.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: quick-start-nodejs
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

To start it, run this command:

```bash
docker compose build # optional if you haven't already built the image
docker compose up
```

This will start the Node.js app. But, you're not sending the traces anywhere.

Let's fix this by configuring Tracetest and OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Tracetest

The `docker-compose.yaml` in the `tracetest` directory is configured with four services.

- **Postgres** - Postgres is a prerequisite for Tracetest to work. It stores trace data when running the trace-based tests.
- [**OpenTelemetry Collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - A vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data.
- [**Tracetest**](https://tracetest.io/) - Trace-based testing that generates end-to-end tests automatically from traces.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tracetest:
    image: kubeshop/tracetest:${TAG:-latest}
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-config.yaml
        target: /app/tracetest.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: ./tracetest/tracetest-provision.yaml
        target: /app/provisioning.yaml
    ports:
      - 11633:11633
    command: --provisioning-file /app/provisioning.yaml
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
      tempo:
        condition: service_started
      otel-collector:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "localhost:11633"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 60
    environment:
      TRACETEST_DEV: ${TRACETEST_DEV}

  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: pg_isready -U "$$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$$POSTGRES_DB"
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 60

  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.59.0
    command:
      - "--config"
      - "/otel-local-config.yaml"
    volumes:
      - ./tracetest/collector.config.yaml:/otel-local-config.yaml
    depends_on:
      - tempo
```

Tracetest depends on Postgres, Tempo and the OpenTelemetry Collector. All three services require config files to be loaded via a volume. The volumes are mapped from the root directory into the `tracetest` directory and the respective config files.

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, we will run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

The `tracetest-config.yaml` file contains the basic setup of connecting Tracetest to the Postgres instance and defining the trace data store and exporter. The exporter is set to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

```yaml
# tracetest-config.yaml

postgres:
  host: postgres
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  port: 5432
  dbname: postgres
  params: sslmode=disable

telemetry:
  exporters:
    collector:
      serviceName: tracetest
      sampling: 100 # 100%
      exporter:
        type: collector
        collector:
          endpoint: otel-collector:4317

server:
  telemetry:
    exporter: collector
```

The `tracetest-provision.yaml` file defines the trace data store, set to Grafana Cloud Tempo, meaning the traces will be stored in Tempo and Tracetest will fetch them from Tempo when running tests.

How does Tracetest fetch traces?

Tracetest uses `https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net/tempo` to connect to Tempo and fetch trace data.

```yaml
# tracetest-provision.yaml

---
type: DataStore
spec:
  name: Grafana Tempo Cloud
  type: tempo
  tempo:
    type: http
    http:
      url: https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net/tempo
      headers:
        Authorization: Basic <grafana_auth_hash>
        # https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/13/how-to-send-traces-to-grafana-clouds-tempo-service-with-opentelemetry-collector/

```

How do traces reach Tempo?

The `collector.config.yaml` explains that. It receives traces via either `grpc` or `http`. Then, exports them to Tempo's OTLP HTTP endpoint `tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443`.

```yaml
# collector.config.yaml

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed
  otlp:
    endpoint: tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443
    headers:
      authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username:password>

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [logging, otlp]
```

## Run Both the Node.js App and Tracetest

To start both the Node.js app and Tracetest, run this command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up # add --build if the images are not built already
```

This will start your Tracetest instance on `http://localhost:11633/`.

Open the URL and start creating tests! Make sure to use the `http://app:8080/` URL in your test creation, because your Node.js app and Tracetest are in the same network.
