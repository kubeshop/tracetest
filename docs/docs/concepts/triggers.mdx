Tracetest uses the concept of Triggers to define how to initiate a test run.

## Native Triggers

Triggers define how Tracetest interacts with your application.

### Web UI

- [HTTP Request - Create a basic HTTP request.](/web-ui/creating-tests-http)
- [GRPC Request - Test and debug your GRPC request.](/web-ui/creating-tests-gRPC)
- [Kafka - Test consumers with Kafka messages.](/web-ui/creating-tests-kafka)
- [Playwright Engine - Run Playwright tests natively in Tracetest.](/web-ui/creating-tests-playwright-engine)
- [GraphQL - Test and debug your GraphQL request.](/web-ui/creating-tests-graphql)
- [TraceID - Define your test via a TraceID.](/web-ui/creating-tests-traceid)

### CLI

The attribute `type` defines which trigger method you are going to use to interact with your application.

```yaml
trigger:
  type: http|grpc|kafka|traceid|cypress|playwright|k6|artillery
...
```

- [HTTP Request - Create a basic HTTP request.](/cli/creating-tests-http)
- [GRPC Request - Test and debug your GRPC request.](/cli/creating-tests-grpc)
- [Kafka - Test consumers with Kafka messages.](/cli/creating-tests-kafka)
- [Playwright Engine - Run Playwright tests natively in Tracetest.](/cli/creating-tests-playwright-engine)
- [GraphQL - Test and debug your GraphQL request.](/cli/creating-tests-graphql)
- [TraceID - Define your test via a TraceID.](/cli/creating-tests-traceid)

## Integrations

Initiate test runs from triggers outside of Tracetest.

- [Cypress](/web-ui/creating-tests-cypress)
- [Playwright](/web-ui/creating-tests-playwright)
- [k6](/web-ui/creating-tests-k6)
- [Artillery](/web-ui/creating-tests-artillery)
