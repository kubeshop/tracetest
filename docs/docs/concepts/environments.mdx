Connect an Agent and/or Trace Data Store to an environment to start creating tests.

You get a `localMode` environment by default. This environment is dedicated to your local development environment for you to play around with while developing your apps.

Create additional environments by clicking the `+ Create a New Environment` button.

Additional environments can be shared between team members, or used as dedicated environments for QA, staging, test, production, or any other shared environment of your choosing.
