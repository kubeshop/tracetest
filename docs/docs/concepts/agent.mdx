Tracetest Agent is a lightweight, dependency-free agent that runs locally in your development environment, or as a Docker container in your Cloud Native infrastructure.

## How It Works

- Tracetest Agent listens for new tests you run from [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io). It executes tests in the environment where it is running and returns the response from the trigger. The environment can be either `localhost`, Docker, or Kubernetes.
- Tracetest Agent listens on OTLP ports `4317` (gRPC) and `4318` (HTTP) for OpenTelemetry trace spans to capture distributed trace data and relay it to [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io).
- Be able to connect to a trace data store that is not accessible outside of your environment. Eg. a Jaeger instance running in the cluster without an ingress controller.
- With both the response and trace, you build tests and create assertions with data from either or both of them.
