Environment Tokens are strings used to authenticate Tracetest CLI against an organization and environment.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djwdcmwdz/image/upload/v1701296331/docs/environment-tokens_gkt9kx.png)

These tokens ared used to configure Tracetest CLI in environment that you cannot login with user interaction, like CI/CD environments.

Create a new token by clicking on the `Create a new token` button, choosing a name, role and expiration and then clicking on `Create`. This will create a token that you can copy and use to configure Tracetest CLI with:

```bash
tracetest configure --token {ADD_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}
```

One example of this usage can be seen [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/blob/main/.github/workflows/scheduled-jobs.yml#L23).
