When running a trace-based testing, a crucial thing to have is the trace generated by the test execution. Usually, these traces are stored
in a tracing backend (Jaeger, Tempo, etc) or they can be sent directly to Tracetest via OpenTelemetry Collector. In both cases, the trace is not
complete as soon as the test is run, the application might run a long-running operation or it's batching generated spans before sending them
to the tracing backend. In any case, spans are not sent instantaneous and are not available for Tracetest as soon as the test trigger is
done running.

This means that Tracetest needs to check periodically if the trace is complete or not. For this, it uses a `Polling Profile`. This profile
tells Tracetest how often and how long to wait for a trace to be done. Every Tracetest environment has one default polling profile, it means that any
test will use that profile when trying to fetch the trace from the tracing backend. However, since version v1.0.0, users can now specify a different
polling profile per test, which makes more sense than having a single profile due to some tests being pretty quick to run and other can take from minutes
to hours to finish executing.

```yaml
# test.yaml
type: Test
spec:
    name: my quick test
    pollingProfile: ./quick-polling-profile.yaml
    trigger:
        type: http
        httpRequest:
            url: http://${env:ENDPOINT}/api/resource
            method: GET
```

```yaml
# quick-polling-profile.yaml
type: PollingProfile
spec:
    name: quick polling profile
    strategy: periodic
    periodic:
        retryDelay: 5s
        timeout: 60s
```

**retryDelay**: how long Tracetest must wait between trace polling tries. If set as 5s, Tracetest will try to get the trace every 5 seconds
**timeout**: how long Tracetest must keep trying getting a trace, if it takes more than the value set in timeout, the test fails
