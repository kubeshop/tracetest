Tracetest has two distinct feature sets:

- [Hobby Self-hosted Open-source Tracetest Core](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest): Free and available on GitHub. Contains the core trace-based testing features. Perfect for hobby usage and non-production workloads.
- [Commercial Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/) (Cloud + On-Prem): The commercial versions of Tracetest include both a cloud-based managed version and an on-prem enterprise version. They contain more advanced features on top of Tracetest Core for larger organizations with platform and observability teams.
