Organization Tokens are strings used to authenticate Tracetest CLI against an organization and the environments and resources within the organization.

These tokens are used to configure environments with the Tracetest CLI. You can configure detailed environment automation with an organization token.

Create a new token by clicking on the `Create a new token` button, choosing a name, role and expiration and then clicking on `Create`.

Two roles are available:

- **Admin** - This token will enable authenticating both the CLI and Tracetest Agent with a single token.
- **Agent** - Thsi token will only be for authenticating and running the Tracetest Agent.

This will create a token that you can copy and use to configure Tracetest CLI with:

```bash
tracetest configure --token {ADD_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}
```
