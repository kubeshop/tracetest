Tracetest Core is an open-source, cloud-native application, packaged and distributed as a Docker image and designed to run in a containerized environment.

We recommend using our managed platform for [Tracetest](https://app.tracetest.io/), because it's the easiest way to build and test with OpenTelemetry. Tracetest includes features such as collaboration for teams and comes with a free tier for development.

However, if you wish to run Tracetest Core in your own infrastructure, check out the guides below.

```mdx-code-block
import {CoreGettingStartedGuideCardsRow} from '@site/src/components/CoreGettingStartedGuide';

<CoreGettingStartedGuideCardsRow />
