This page showcases getting started with Tracetest Core by using the Tracetest CLI, Docker, or Kubernetes.

This simple installation includes a demo app called [Pokeshop](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview.md) that will be installed alongside Tracetest Core. It shows how to configure OpenTelemetry and Tracetest Core and the architecture of the Pokeshop sample app.

## Install the Tracetest CLI

## Install the Tracetest Server

Tracetest Core runs as a standalone container. It runs a Server and exposes a Web UI on port `11633`.

You have three options to install Tracetest Server:

- Using the Tracetest CLI to guide your installation in Docker and Kubernetes.
- Using the official [Helm chart](https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tracetest).
- Using the [Docker Compose Quick Start with the Pokeshop Sample App](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/quick-start-pokeshop).

    {`How do you want to run Tracetest? [type to search]:

    </CodeBlock>

Choose to install Tracetest with the OpenTelemetry Collector and the [Pokeshop](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview.md) sample app.

Do you have OpenTelemetry based tracing already set up, or would you like us to install a demo tracing environment and app? [type to search]: 
  I have a tracing environment already. - Just install Tracetest.
> Just learning tracing! Install Tracetest, OpenTelemetry Collector and the sample app.
```

Choosing any option, this installer will create a `tracetest` directory in the current directory and add a `docker-compose.yaml` file to it.

- If you choose the first option, the `docker-compose.yaml` will have only Tracetest Core and its dependencies.
- **By choosing the second option, a sample app called [Pokeshop](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview.md) will be installed with Tracetest Core, allowing you to create sample tests right away!**

  </summary>

Here's the Architecture of the Pokeshop Sample App:

- an **API** that serves client requests,
- a **Worker** who deals with background processes.

The communication between the API and Worker is made using a `RabbitMQ` queue, and both services emit telemetry data to OpenTelemetry Collector and communicate with a Postgres database.

Tracetest triggers tests against the Node.js API.

<CodeBlock

{`docker compose -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up -d`}
</CodeBlock>

This will start the Tracetest Server and expose the Web UI on [`http://localhost:11633`](http://localhost:11633).

```

Choosing any option, this installer will create a `tracetest` namespace in the Kubernetes context you choose and create deployments for Tracetest Core and its dependencies.

- If you choose the first option, the `tracetest` namespace will only contain Tracetest Core and its dependencies.
- **By choosing the second option, a sample app called [Pokeshop](/live-examples/pokeshop/overview.md) will be installed in a `demo` namespace alongside Tracetest Core, allowing you to create sample tests right away!**

**Access the Tracetest Server by port forwarding to the Tracetest `service`.**

```bash title=Terminal
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace demo -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=pokemon-api,app.kubernetes.io/instance=demo" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod --namespace demo $POD_NAME -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort}")
kubectl --namespace demo port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
echo "Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 to view the Pokeshop demo app"

kubectl --kubeconfig <path-to-your-home>/.kube/config --context <your-cluster-context> --namespace tracetest port-forward svc/tracetest 11633
echo "Open http://127.0.0.1:11633 to view the Tracetest Web UI"
```

Access the Tracetest Web UI on [`http://localhost:11633`](http://localhost:11633).

  <TabItem value="helm" label="Helm Chart">

First, be sure that you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed in your machine.

The Tracetest Helm charts are located [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tracetest).

You can install them locally on your machine with the command:

```bash title=Terminal
helm repo add kubeshop https://kubeshop.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

After that, you can install Tracetest with `helm install`:

```bash title=Terminal
helm install tracetest kubeshop/tracetest --namespace=tracetest --create-namespace
```

Or, generate a manifest file and apply it manually in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash title=Terminal
helm template tracetest kubeshop/tracetest > tracetest-kubernetes-manifests.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./tracetest-kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

**Access the Tracetest Server by port forwarding to the Tracetest `service`.**

```bash title=Terminal
kubectl --kubeconfig <path-to-your-home>/.kube/config --context <your-cluster-context> --namespace tracetest port-forward svc/tracetest 11633
```

Access the Tracetest Web UI on [`http://localhost:11633`](http://localhost:11633).

:::tip Don't have OpenTelemetry installed?
Tracetest requires that you have [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/) added in your code, and configured [sending traces to a trace data store](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/jaeger.md), or [Tracetest directly](/configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/opentelemetry-collector.md).
