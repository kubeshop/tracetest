There are several configuration options with Tracetest Core:

- [Server configuration](/core/configuration/server) to set database connection information needed to connect to required PostgreSQL instance.
- [Provisioning configuration](/core/configuration/provisioning) to 'preload' the Tracetest server with resources when first running the Tracetest server.

## Supported Trace Data Stores

Tracetest is designed to work with different trace data stores. To enable Tracetest to run end-to-end tests against trace data, you need to configure Tracetest to access trace data.

Currently, Tracetest supports the [following data stores](/configuration/overview).

## Configuring Tracetest Server

Tracetest has a configuration file to contain the minimal information needed to start the Tracetest server. See more at [Tracetest Server Configuration](/core/configuration/server).

You can also provision the server when it first starts, configuring most aspects of your Tracetest server environment. This is useful in a CI/CD environment to preload and configure the server. See more at [Provisioning a Tracetest Server](/core/configuration/provisioning).

Many of the server configuration settings can be set individually in the UI or via the CLI.

- [Test Runner](/configuration/test-runner)

- [Telemetry](/core/configuration/telemetry)
