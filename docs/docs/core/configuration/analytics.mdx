## Changing Analytics Settings from the UI

In the Tracetest Web UI, open (1) Settings and select the (2) Analytics tab:

From this analytics settings page, you can enable or disable the analytics.

## Changing Analytics Settings with the CLI

Or, if you prefer to use the CLI, you can use this file config to disable analytics:

```yaml

  analyticsEnabled: false
```

Proceed to run this command in the terminal and specify the file above.

```bash
tracetest apply config -f my/resource/analytics-resource.yaml
```
