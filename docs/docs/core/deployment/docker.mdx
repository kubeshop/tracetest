This guide walks you through using the Tracetest CLI to deploy Tracetest Core with Docker.

:::note
This is an example of a production-ready deployment, but real-world deployments can vary significantly depending on desired performance and scale.
:::

Tracetest Core runs in parallel with your Dockerized application, allowing you to interact with your app and its traces, including create and run tests against them.

After installing the CLI, run:

```bash
tracetest server install
```

```bash title="Expected output"
How do you want to run TraceTest? [type to search]:
> Using Docker Compose
  Using Kubernetes
```

Select `Using Docker Compose` and follow the instructions.

**Tools required (installed if missing)**:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

**Optionals**:

- [PokeShop demo app](https://github.com/kubeshop/pokeshop/). A sample microservice app to test your Tracetest installation.
- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/). A trace collector, that receives telemetry of other applications and sent it to Tracetest.

**Result**:

- `tracetest/` directory (configurable) with a `docker-compose.yaml` and other config files.
- [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), if selected.
- [PokeShop demo app](https://github.com/kubeshop/pokeshop/), if selected.

**How to start**:

In the folder where you ran `tracetest server install`, run this command to start the Tracetest cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f tracetest/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

```bash title="Condensed expected output from the Tracetest container:"
Starting tracetest ...
...
2022/11/28 18:24:09 HTTP Server started
...
```

Then launch a browser to [http://localhost:11633/](http://localhost:11633/).
