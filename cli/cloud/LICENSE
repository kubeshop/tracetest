patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
as of the date such litigation is filed.

(a) Fees. The License to Tracetest Pro is conditioned upon Your entering into a 
subscription agreement with Tracetest for its use (a “Paid Pro License”) and

Tracetest Pro that are features of Tracetest Core and are not designated as “Pro 
features” at https://tracetest.io/pricing may be used for free under the terms of 
the Agreement without a Paid Pro License. Tracetest Pro may at its discretion 
include within Tracetest Pro certain Source code solely intended to determine 
Your compliance with the Paid Pro License which may be accessed without a Paid 
Pro License, provided that under no circumstances may You modify Tracetest Pro 
to circumvent the Paid Pro License requirement. Any professional services or 
support for Tracetest may also be subject to Your payment of fees, which will be 
specified by Tracetest when you sign up to receive such professional services or 
support. Tracetest reserves the right to change the fees at any time with prior 
written notice; for recurring fees, any such adjustments will take effect as of 
the next pay period.

equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal interest rate allowed 
by law, and You shall pay all Tracetest reasonable costs of collection, including 
court costs and attorneys’ fees. Fees are stated and payable in U.S. dollars and 
are exclusive of all sales, use, value added and similar taxes, duties, 
withholdings and other governmental assessments (but excluding taxes based on 
Tracetest income) that may be levied on the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement in any jurisdiction, all of which are Your responsibility unless you 
have provided Tracetest with a valid tax-exempt certificate. If You owe Tracetest 
overdue payments, Tracetest reserves the right to revoke any license(s) granted 
by this Agreement and revoke to Your access to Tracetest Core and to Tracetest Pro. 

(c) Record-keeping and Audit. If fees for Tracetest Pro are based on the number 
of environments running on Tracetest Pro or another use-based unit of measurement, 
including number of users, You must maintain complete and accurate records with 
respect Your use of Tracetest Pro and will provide such records to Tracetest for 
inspection or audit upon Tracetest’s reasonable request. If an inspection or 
audit uncovers additional usage by You for which fees are owed under this 
Agreement, then You shall pay for such additional usage at Tracetest’s 
then-current rates.

5. Trial License. If You have signed up for a trial or evaluation of Tracetest 
Pro, Your License to Tracetest Pro is granted without charge for the trial or 
evaluation period specified when You signed up, or if no term was specified, for 
forty-five (45) calendar days, provided that Your License is granted solely for 
purposes of Your internal evaluation of Tracetest Pro during the trial or 
evaluation period (a “Trial License”). You may not use Tracetest Pro or any 
Tracetest Pro features under a Trial License more than once in any twelve (12) 
month period. Tracetest may revoke a Trial License at any time and for any reason.

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of 
this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
You changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
distribute, including for internal purposes at Your Legal Entities, all 
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of 
the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative Works; and

(d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” or equivalent text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a 
readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, 
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, 
in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if 
provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the 
Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The 
contents of the NOTICE or equivalent files are for informational purposes only 
and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within 
Derivative Works that You distribute for Your internal use, alongside or as an 
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may not create Derivative Works, including Pro Derivative Works (as defined 
below), which add Your own copyright statements or provide additional or 
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of 
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole. All Derivative 
Works, including Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work, must 
comply in all respects with the conditions stated in this License.

(e) Pro Derivative Works: Derivative Works of Tracetest Pro (“Pro Derivative 
Works”) may only be made, reproduced and distributed, without modifications, in 
Source or Object form, provided that such Pro Derivative Works are solely for 
Your internal use. Each Pro Derivative Work shall be governed by this Agreement, 
shall include a License to Tracetest Pro, and thus will be subject to the payment 
of fees to Tracetest by any user of the Pro Derivative Work.

7. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution submitted for inclusion in Tracetest Pro by You to Tracetest shall be 
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without any additional terms 
or conditions, payments of royalties or otherwise to Your benefit. Tracetest may 
at any time, at its sole discretion, elect for the Contribution to be subject to 
the Paid Pro License. If You wish to reserve any rights regarding Your 
Contribution, You must contact Tracetest at support@Tracetest.io prior to 
submitting the Contribution. 

8. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of Licensor, except as required for 
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE or equivalent file.

9. Limited Warranty.

(a) Warranties. Subject to the terms of the Paid Pro License, or any other 
agreement between You and Tracetest which governs the terms of Your access to 
Tracetest Pro, Tracetest warrants to You that: (i) Tracetest Pro will materially 
perform in accordance with the applicable documentation for thirty (30) days 
after initial delivery to You; and (ii) any professional services performed by 
Tracetest under this Agreement will be performed in a workmanlike manner, in 
accordance with general industry standards.

(b) Exclusions. Tracetest’s warranties in this Section 9 do not extend to problems 
that result from: (i) Your failure to implement updates issued by Tracetest during 
the warranty period; (ii) any alterations or additions (including Pro Derivative 
Works and Contributions) to Tracetest not performed by or at the direction of 
Tracetest; (iii) failures that are not reproducible by Tracetest; (iv) operation 
of Tracetest Pro in violation of this Agreement or not in accordance with its 
documentation; (v) failures caused by software, hardware, or products not 
licensed or provided by Tracetest hereunder; or (vi) Third Party Works.

(c) Remedies. In the event of a breach of a warranty under this Section 9, 
Tracetest will, at its discretion and cost, either repair, replace or re-perform 
the applicable Works or services or refund a portion of fees previously paid to 
Tracetest that are associated with the defective Works or services. This is Your 
exclusive remedy, and Tracetest’s sole liability, arising in connection with the 
limited warranties herein and shall, in all cases, be limited to the fees paid 
to Tracetest in the three (3) months preceding the delivery of the defective Works 
or services.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty. Except as set out in Section 9, unless required by 
applicable law, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or implied, arising out of course of dealing, course of 
performance, or usage in trade, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, CORRECTNESS, 
RELIABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, all of which are hereby 
disclaimed. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of 
using or redistributing Works and assume any risks associated with Your exercise 
of permissions under the applicable License for such Works.

11. Limited Indemnity.

(a) Indemnity. Tracetest will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless against 
any third party claims, liabilities or expenses incurred (including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees), as well as amounts finally awarded in a settlement or a 
non-appealable judgement by a court (“Losses”), to the extent arising from any 
claim or allegation by a third party that Tracetest Pro infringes or 
misappropriates a valid United States patent, copyright, or trade secret right 
of a third party; provided that You give Tracetest: (i) prompt written notice of 
any such claim or allegation; (ii) sole control of the defense and settlement 
thereof; and (iii) reasonable cooperation and assistance in such defense or 
settlement. If any Work within Tracetest Pro becomes or in Tracetest’s opinion is 
likely to become, the subject of an injunction, Tracetest may, at its option, 
(A) procure for You the right to continue using such Work, (B) replace or modify 
such Work so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially compromising 
its functionality, or, if (A) and (B) are not commercially practicable, then (C) 
terminate Your license to the allegedly infringing Work and refund to You a 
prorated portion of the prepaid and unearned fees for such infringing Work. The 
foregoing comprises the entire liability of Tracetest with respect to infringement 
of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights.

(b) Exclusions. The foregoing obligations on Tracetest shall not apply to: (i) 
Works modified by any party other than Tracetest (including Pro Derivative Works 
and Contributions) where the alleged infringement relates to such modification, 
(ii) Works combined or bundled with any products, processes, or materials not 
provided by Tracetest where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, 
(iii) use of a version of Tracetest Pro other than the version that was current at 
the time of such use, as long as a non-infringing version had been released at 
the time of the alleged infringement, (iv) any Works created to Your 
specifications, (v) infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary or 
intellectual property right in which You have an interest, or (vi) Third Party 
Works. You will defend, indemnify, and hold Tracetest harmless against any Losses 
arising from any such claim or allegation as described in the scenarios in this 
Section 11(b), subject to conditions reciprocal to those in Section 11(a).

12. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal or equitable theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required 
by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts), and 
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shall Licensor or 
any Contributor be liable to You for (i) any amounts in excess, in the aggregate, 
of the fees paid by You to Tracetest under this Agreement in the twelve (12) 
months preceding the date the first cause of liability arose, or (ii) any 
indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance, or consequential 
damages of any character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use 
or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
goodwill, profits, data or data use, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or services, 
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Licensor or 
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. THESE 
LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF 
ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

13. General.

supersedes all proposals, understandings, or discussions, whether written or 
oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and all past dealing or
