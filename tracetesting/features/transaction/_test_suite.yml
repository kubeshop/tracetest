  description: Sequence of tests to validate if our Transaction feature is working as expected
  steps:
    # create test that will be added to a transaction
    - ./01_create_transaction_step.yml
    # create transaction that will group these steps
    - ./02_create_transaction.yml
    # check if this transaction is listed on API
    # - ./list_transaction.yml
    # delete transaction
    # - ./delete_transaction.yml
    # delete transaction steps
    # - ./delete_transaction_steps.yml
