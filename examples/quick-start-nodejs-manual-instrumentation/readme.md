# Quick Start - Node.js app with OpenTelemetry and Tracetest that includes manual instrumentation

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store-with-manual-instrumentation)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing. This example includes manual instrumentation and a sample bookstore array that simulates fetching data from a database.
