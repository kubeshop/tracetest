# Tracetesting Event-driven systems

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store)

This is a simple example from the article "Testing Event-driven Systems with OpenTelemetry" showing how to test an event-driven system using [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a event backbone.

If you want to run this example, just execute `docker compose up` on this folder.

TODO: To execute a Trace-based test with Tracetest against this structure just run `tracetest run test -f test.yaml`.
