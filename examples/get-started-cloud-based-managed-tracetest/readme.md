# Get Started with Cloud-based Managed Tracetest

Tracetest integrates observability and testing in software development through distributed tracing. With Tracetest, you can embrace test-driven development with observability, test against real data, and say goodbye to time-consuming mocks and black box testing.

Key features include:

- Correlation of failing requests with distributed traces 🔍
- Root cause analysis via span-level insights 👀
- Assertion capabilities against both response data and distributed trace data 🧪

Tracetest enables:

- Test-driven development with observability — coined Observability-driven development ‼️
- Testing against real data
- Not spending time on mocks
- Comprehensive system visibility

This example covers all 4 deployment architectures:

- Local
- Docker (Compose)
- Kubernetes (Helm)
- Serverless
