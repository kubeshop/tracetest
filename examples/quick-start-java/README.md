# Quick Start - Java app with OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store)
This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Java app (with [Spring](https://spring.io/)) to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing.

The Java API was created with OpenTelemetry instrumentation using the [OpenTelemetry with Java guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/getting-started/).

To run it just execute `docker compose up` on this folder.
