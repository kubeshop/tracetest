# Quick Start - Ruby app with OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Ruby app (with [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) framework) to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing.

To run it just execute `docker compose up` on this folder.

Feel free to check out the [docs](https://docs.tracetest.io/), and join our [Slack Community](https://dub.sh/tracetest-community) for more info!
