# Quick Start - Ruby on Rails app with OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store)
This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Ruby app (with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework) to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing.

The Ruby on Rails API was created using the [Rails guide for API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) and the OpenTelemetry instrumentation using the [OpenTelemetry with Ruby guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/ruby/getting-started/).

To run it just execute `docker compose up` on this folder.
