# Running Tracetest with Keptn

[Tracetest](https://tracetest.io/) is a testing tool based on OpenTelemetry that permits you to test your distributed application. It allows you to use your trace data generated on your OpenTelemetry tools to check and assert if your application has the desired behavior defined by your test definitions.

[Keptn](https://keptn.sh/) is a powerful tool to automate the lifecycle of your application running on Kubernetes. One of the tasks that we can do on `keptn` is to test an application and see if it is healthy and ready to be used by your users.

In this folder, you can see the assets to do a `Quickstart` on Tracetest and Keptn integration. To see more details about this integration please access the following link:
