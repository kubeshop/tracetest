# Running Tracetest with Keptn

[Keptn](https://keptn.sh/) is a powerful tool to automate the lifecycle of your application running on Kubernetes. One of the tasks that we can do on `keptn` is to test an application and see if it is healthy and ready to be used by your users.

In this folder, you can see the assets to do a `Quickstart` on Tracetest and Keptn integration. To see more details about this integration please access the following link:
