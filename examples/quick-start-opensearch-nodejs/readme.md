# Quick Start - Node.js app with OpenSearch, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenSearch with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-with-opensearch)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use OpenSearch as the trace data store and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to OpenSearch.
