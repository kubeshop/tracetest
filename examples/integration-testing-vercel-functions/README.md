# Integration Testing Vercel Functions with Tracetest and OpenTelemetry

This example is from the article [**Integration Testing Vercel Serverless Functions and OpenTelemetry**](https://tracetest.io/blog/integration-testing-vercel-serverless-functions-with-opentelemetry) showing how to run integration tests against Vercel Functions using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and Tracetest.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It's using Vercel Functions via `/pages/api`, with [OpenTelemetry configured as explained in the Vercel docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry#manual-opentelemetry-configuration).
