# Testing Cloudflare Workers with Tracetest and OpenTelemetry

This example is from the article [**Crafting Observable Cloudflare Workers with OpenTelemetry**](https://tracetest.io/blog/crafting-observable-cloudflare-workers-with-opentelemetry) showing how to run integration and staging tests against Cloudflare Workers using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and Tracetest.

This is a project bootstrapped with [`C3 (create-cloudflare-cli)`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#1-create-a-new-worker-project).

It's using Cloudflare Workers with [OpenTelemetry configured with otel-cf-workers](https://github.com/evanderkoogh/otel-cf-workers).
