# Quick Start - Node.js app with Jaeger, OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up Jaeger with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-with-jaeger)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure a Node.js app to use OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces and Tracetest for enhancing your E2E and integration tests with trace-based testing. The infrastructure will use Jaeger as the trace data store, and OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from the Node.js app and send them to Jaeger.
