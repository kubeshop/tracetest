# Quick Start - Synthetic Monitoring with Trace-based Tests using a Node.js app with OpenTelemetry

> [Read the detailed recipe with Tracetest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/synthetic-monitoring-trace-based-api-tests)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure trace-based synthetic testing / monitoring with a Node.js app and OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces. This example includes manual instrumentation and a sample bookstore array that simulates fetching data from a database.
