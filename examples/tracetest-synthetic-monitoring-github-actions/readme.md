# Synthetic monitoring with Tracetest and GitHub Actions

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up OpenTelemetry Collector with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/examples-tutorials/recipes/running-tracetest-without-a-trace-data-store)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure Tracetest and GitHub Actions to emulate synthetic monitoring using your existing Tracetest tests. The idea behind this example
is to have a way of running a set of tests using Tracetest on a schedule and notify a Slack channel in case the test fails. This way, you can keep testing your application and
identifying issues constantly.

This example is based on the [Golang quick-start example](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/quick-start-go). All important information about
how to run synthetic monitoring using Tracetest can be found in the [.github/workflows/synthetic-monitoring.yaml](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/tree/main/examples/tracetest-synthetic-monitoring/.github/workflows/synthetic-monitoring.yaml) file.
