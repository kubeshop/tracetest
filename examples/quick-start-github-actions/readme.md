# GitHub Actions Sample for a Node.js app with OpenTelemetry and Tracetest

> [Read the detailed recipe for setting up GitHub Actions with Tractest in our documentation.](https://docs.tracetest.io/ci-cd-automation/github-actions-pipeline)

This is a simple quick start on how to configure GitHub Actions to run Tracetest against a Node.js app that uses OpenTelemetry instrumentation with traces, to enhance your e2e and integration tests with trace-based testing.
