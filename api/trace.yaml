    default: SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED
    description: |-
      SpanKind is the type of span. Can be used to specify additional relationships between spans
      in addition to a parent/child relationship.

       - SPAN_KIND_UNSPECIFIED: Unspecified. Do NOT use as default.
      Implementations MAY assume SpanKind to be INTERNAL when receiving UNSPECIFIED.
       - SPAN_KIND_INTERNAL: Indicates that the span represents an internal operation within an application,
      as opposed to an operation happening at the boundaries. Default value.
       - SPAN_KIND_SERVER: Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other
      remote network request.
       - SPAN_KIND_CLIENT: Indicates that the span describes a request to some remote service.
       - SPAN_KIND_PRODUCER: Indicates that the span describes a producer sending a message to a broker.
      Unlike CLIENT and SERVER, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
      between producer and consumer spans. A PRODUCER span ends when the message was accepted
      by the broker while the logical processing of the message might span a much longer time.
       - SPAN_KIND_CONSUMER: Indicates that the span describes consumer receiving a message from a broker.
      Like the PRODUCER kind, there is often no direct critical path latency relationship
      between producer and consumer spans.

      KeyValueList is a list of KeyValue messages. We need KeyValueList as a message

    description: |-
      Span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be
      nested to form a trace tree. Spans may also be linked to other spans
      from the same or different trace and form graphs. Often, a trace
      contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one
      or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace can also contain
      multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to be
      contiguous - there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
