# Tracetest

Tracetest is a trace-based testing tool that leverages the data contained in your distributed traces to produce easy to create, yet super powerful integration tests. You can verify activity deep inside your system, even events that occur on 'the other side' of an async message queue. Verifying the timing of different steps in your process via an automated test is also a valuable use case.

# Features

- Test by executing a REST or gRPC call to trigger the test. Can also import your Postman Collections.
- [Add assertions](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/adding-assertions/) based on return data from trigger call and/or data contained in the spans in your distributed trace.
- Enables white box testing in which internal structure, design and coding of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to improve design, usability and security.
- Specify which spans to check in assertions via the [advanced selector language](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/advanced-selectors/).
- Define checks against the attributes in these spans, including properties, return status, or timing.
- Tests can be created via graphical UI or via [Yaml-based test definition file](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/test-definition-file/).
- Use the test definition file to [enable Gitops flows](https://kubeshop.io/blog/integrating-tracetest-with-github-actions-in-a-ci-pipelinehttps://kubeshop.io/blog/integrating-tracetest-with-github-actions-in-a-ci-pipeline).
- [Tracetest CLI](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/command-line-tool/) allows importing & exporting tests, running tests, and more.
- Tests are [versioned](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/versioning/) as the definition of the test is altered.
- Supports [numerous backend trace datastores](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/architecture/), including Jeager and Grafana Tempo. Tell us which others you want!
- Easy [install via Helm command](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/installing/).
- Install can include [an example microservice](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/pokeshop/) that is instrumented with OpenTelemetry to use as an example application under test.

# How does Tracetest work?

1. Pick an endpoint to test.
2. Run a test, and get the trace.
3. The trace is the blueprint of your system under test. It shows all the steps the system has taken to execute the request.
4. Use this blueprint to define assertions through Tracetest UI.
5. Add assertions on different services, checking return statuses, data, or even execution times of a system.
6. Run the tests.

Once the test is built, it can be run automatically as part of a build process. Every test has a trace attached, allowing you to immediately see what worked, and what did not, reducing the need to reproduce the problem to see the underlying issue.

# Getting Started

The [install](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/installing/) only takes a few minutes, and is done with via a Helm command. After installing, take a look at the
[Getting Started](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/getting-started/) guides to set up Tracetest and
run your first test.
